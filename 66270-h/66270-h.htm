<p>It is natural for girls to wish to marry.
The desire to do so is not to be condemned,
but rather applauded, for it is Heaven-born.
The Creator implanted it in the human
heart, man and woman alike. God made
man for woman and woman for man. He did
not intend that they should live apart from
each other. When He said, “It is not good
for man to be alone,” He included woman
in the man. It is not good for woman to<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
live alone. He put a longing in the heart of
man and woman alike which is only satisfied
by the love of the other. He made a void
in the heart which can only be filled by the
companionship and love of one of the opposite
sex. Man and woman are alike in this.
It is as natural to her as to him: she can no
more help it than he can. The unnatural
part is that a woman must keep still about
it, and if no one comes to woo, try to stifle
the longing.</p>

<p>There are plenty who hold up their hands
in holy horror when it is said that a certain
girl wishes to marry. It is nothing at all out
of the way when <em>Mr. Jones</em> says <em>he</em> has determined
to marry. If his sister Mollie gave
voice to such a sentiment, it would be shocking,
however. It would be shocking for her
to give expression to the longing the all-wise
Father has implanted in her heart. It is a
heart, too, that will never be satisfied with<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
<a id="Ref_7" href="#BRef_R7">yearning</a> only, with fame, with any vocation,
with dumb animals, with other people’s
children; and it is a wise thing it will not. It
is not a wise thing, however, that Mollie will
be condemned because she cannot be satisfied
without having a fireside and home of
her own, because she wants a big loving
fellow to care for her and to protect her,
and whom she can love and make happy,
because she wants her own home, no matter
how small it is, to adorn and make pretty,
her own housekeeping to look after, her
own and his children to care for; because
she wants her own wifehood, just as her
brother wants a wife and home of his own
and will not be satisfied to be a bachelor.</p>

<p>Let him make up his mind to marry. The
world will approve of his decision. Let
Mollie do the same thing. I want to see
girls marry. I am always glad when I hear
that one is engaged to do so. To help some<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
to do so, I write these few chapters. There
are too many old maids. There are more
than there need to be.</p>

<p>I feel particularly sorry for the girl who
has passed the line of youth and who has no
admirers. Her brothers are all married, and
most of her girlhood friends are absorbed in
a husband and a baby. She has none, when
doubtless she has it within her to make a
good wife and mother. She is often restless,
unsatisfied, disappointed. If she is at
all weak-minded, she becomes sour as she
grows older. She grows envious of all
happily married women, and has a secret
grudge toward men because she feels that
she has been slighted by the sex generally.
Many a girl who would make a good wife is
soured by her failure to become one, and
turns out an unpleasant member of society.
All old maids are not by any means like this,
however. There are many unmarried women<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
in the world that will take up cheerfully any
fate, turning their disappointment into a
blessing for others.</p>

<p>But I fear that, after all, they go through
life with a heart unsatisfied. Alone, when
they look into the secret chambers of that
uncomplaining heart, they see there the old
longings for love.</p>

<p>There are unmarried women who do a
great deal of good in the world. They
accept their solitary lot as the will of the
Heavenly Father. But is it His will? Does
He give the heart longings which He will
not satisfy? No. A thousand times, No.
That would be tantalizing us. Too often
we make mistakes in life, and then declare
the consequences to be His will. It is so in
failing to marry. Girls make mistakes in
their conduct and remain spinsters. The
fault is their own. They do not know how
to attract, and so are passed by.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>

<p>Plenty of girls do so well understand the
art of attracting men, that they have numberless
offers of marriage. I know women
who could not count up on their ten fingers
the men who have been in love with them:
among them men who for their sakes have
remained unmarried through life. I have
had personal acquaintance with women who
have been married three times, and could,
some of them, be married again. I know
other women who have never had one admirer.</p>

<p>I know girls who can attract men to them,
and almost as soon as they are attracted, repel
them. That sort of a girl never marries.
She wants to do so, and acts through ignorance.
I have sometimes felt like giving a
girl a good shaking when I have seen her
spoil her own chances. I have been dying
to whisper a word of advice at times, but
was too wise to do so, knowing it would not<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
be well received. Girls know so fearfully
much! The experiences of a mature woman
count for nothing beside the wonderful
knowledge some girls in their teens have!
In the hope that some of these maidens will
be willing to read what they would not hear,
when it was too personal, I determined to
write down what I know about being attractive
to the other sex, what I know about
girls’ failures, and why they fail.</p>

<p>Not long ago there appeared in “The
Woman’s Department” of one of our daily
papers a letter from a young girl, in which
she confessed that she loved a young man
who did not return her affection. She asked
what she should do to win him. The editor
could not tell her, advising her to give
him up, very much as if it were a pleasure
excursion the poor girl was writing about.
There are times when it is necessary to give
up all hope of winning a man. This, however,<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>
did not appear to have been one of
them. The girl should have been told just
how she could attract, then win him. Perhaps
the editor did not herself know.</p>

<p>If a girl is thrown much in the society of
a young man whose affections are not previously
engaged, and if she knows how to
do it, she is quite sure to make him love
her. If, however, he cares for some one
else, who cares for him, no true woman will
in any way try to come between the two:
she will rather avoid doing so. If the girl
has become interested before she knows of
his engagement, it is a case of misplaced
affections. There I must advise giving him
up. Get interested in another man, and win
that one. It might be well always for a girl
to find out first whether or not a man is
interested in some one else. That would
often save a world of trouble. A misplaced
affection, when foolishly adhered to<span class="pagenum">[13]</span>
will stand in the way of a happy marriage.
It is not always the <em>man</em> you love. Not
unfrequently it is your ideal which you
make a certain man fill. Often, if you are
not blinded, you will see that instead of
filling it, he “wobbles” around in the large
space you have given him. That ideal can
easily be transferred to another man. Very
few hearts are so true that they love but
once. They may do so in stories, but in
real life we change. We rarely marry our
first love, and almost always forget all about
him.</p>

<p>After marriage it is a different thing.
Then it is no ideal: it is real. The
man you love is real. The love is real,
and continues even after “death do you
part.”</p>

<p>So, let no misplaced affection stand between
you and marriage. Return a love if
it is offered you and the man is desirable, or<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
set yourself to win one. Do not go about
sighing for a man who belongs to another
girl. He never gives you a thought&mdash;they
are hers. Have too much self-respect, and
too high an opinion of your charms to think
about him. In a few years, impossible as it
may seem now, when you meet him middle-aged
and a family man, you will wonder
what you ever saw in him to care about. This
sounds heartless, but it is true. It goes to
prove that in early life before marriage it is
the ideal and not the man a girl often loves.
If I am mistaken in that, I am not mistaken
in saying that a girl is happier married
to a man for whom she cares less than
she did for this ideal, than in remaining a
spinster because some other girl bore off the
heart she craved. To my mind a woman is
happier married under almost any circumstances
than single. That I know is against
the teachings of to-day, and does not savor<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
the least of woman’s rights. I believe her
“rights” is to be married.</p>

<p>Sometimes a girl who is attractive enough
to win any man is kept from marriage by
the selfish attentions of one man who either
cannot or will not say anything to her about
marrying him. This is not an unfrequent
occurrence. A man who, on account of his
circumstances, cannot marry, or who, because
he prefers his freedom, will not marry, will
pay attention to a girl for years. He wins
her affections, and keeps away others who
would be glad to marry her. Meantime she
hopes that every day she will hear the words
he has given her a right to expect to hear.
In the end, if she allows this thing to continue,
she will be an old maid.</p>

<p>No matter how much you care for a man,
give him up if, after a certain length of time,
he says nothing to you about marriage. You
will lose nothing in the end by doing so, and<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
may gain him. If he really cares for you,
the danger of losing you will make him
more anxious to possess you. Then, if ever,
he will find means to ask you to marry him.
If he does not then, he never would. If
giving him up hurts you, heal the wound by
remembering that his intentions could not
have been serious, and that he has allowed
himself to lose you. Remember, too, that
the hurt will come some time, anyway, and
most likely when you are beyond the age
to attract any one else. So giving him up
while you are yet young means a marriage
with some other man. Clinging weakly to
him means, without doubt, that he will, when
you are no longer young and attractive, cast
you away for a fairer face.</p>

<p>Never so far forget your self-respect as to
ask a dilatory lover his intentions. Never allow
your father or brother so to demean you.
If a man has intentions, no matter how bashful<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
he is, he will declare them. If he does not
do so, he has none, and you had better give
up all hope in that direction. There are always
plenty more men about who will care
for you, and who will let you know it too.</p>

<p>Three such cases have come to my knowledge.
The girl acted differently in each one.
The first clung to her dilatory lover till he
finally left her when she was too old to
attract any one else. Now, alone in the
world, she supports herself by keeping a
boarding-house. The second one had her
father ask the lover his intentions, and in
that way roped him in. It was not a happy
marriage. A third gave up the man who
would not propose, and shortly afterwards
married another man for whom she grew to
care a great deal more.</p>

<p>Some attractive girls live in small towns
where they can meet no one whom they
could or would marry. Consequently they<span class="pagenum">[18]</span>
have to remain single. In such a case a man
would go out and seek a wife. A girl cannot
exactly do that. She can, however,
sometimes change her place of residence for
that purpose. When it makes little difference,
as far as business is concerned, where
a family live, I believe a father owes this
duty to his unmarried daughters. He can
take her where she will be likely to meet an
eligible man. I once knew a father with
two young daughters who left his country
home for their sakes. He took a nice house
in Philadelphia, and remained there till they
were both married, then returned home.
A widow with three daughters left her farm
and rented a large furnished house in New
York City. As a means of support she
took first-class boarders. The eldest was
considerably over thirty, but they were all
three attractive. Being so placed where
they met gentlemen, none of them were<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
long in marrying. A maiden lady of forty-one,
very jolly, bright, and good-natured, interesting
but not pretty, and so fleshy she was a sight,
had never in the east met a man whom she could
marry. She went to California to visit a sister,
and in less than a year was married to a wealthy
widower.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE GIRL WHOM MEN LIKE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Leaving matrimony out of the question,
it is desirable for a girl to aim to be a favorite
with men generally. She should be a
girl whom all men like, whether or not that
liking ripens into a feeling more tender.
Then she always stands the chance of its so
ripening. Many a man goes through life
till he has made a success of his business
without giving a thought to marriage.
When he is ready to marry, he looks about
him without any sentiment often to see
whom of his lady friends he would like for a
wife. Ten to one he hits upon a girl whose
character has called forth his friendly admiration.
This once settled he straightway<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
falls in love with something to build upon.
Widowers will frequently marry a girl of
whom they thought well when the wife was
yet living.</p>

<p>Mere beauty counts for less in the long
run than is generally supposed. It has less
power in determining matrimonial choice
than you would think. Its first effects are too
strong in proportion to its other effects. It
is seen at once, and instead of growing upon
the beholder, its power rather lessens as it
becomes familiar. The two most beautiful
girls I ever met are now old maids. The
most winning girl I ever knew had absolutely
a plain face. There was a charm
about her which attracted all men, and
which made them swear, after they knew
her, that she was a most beautiful creature.
Even after she had refused a man, he loved
and admired her.</p>

<p>You all want to look as pretty as you can,<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
but you must not place any dependence upon
beauty to settle you in life. Many men prefer
stylish girls to pretty ones. Look about
you at the married women of your acquaintance.
How few of them are pretty now,
or were in their youth. Two of the worst
wives I have ever known are pretty women.
Their husbands made the mistake of marrying
for beauty. A vain girl is generally selfish,
and men do like an unselfish girl. A
man wants an unselfish wife.</p>

<p>If you wish men to admire you, you must
first be a true woman with a noble character.
Look to your home-life. Men catch
glimpses of that when you least think it.
They know well that an industrious, sweet-tempered,
unselfish daughter makes an industrious,
sweet-tempered, unselfish wife. A
girl of whom her brother is very fond, and
whose special friend she is, goes into the
society of men, where it is known, with a<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
wonderful recommendation. As a general
thing you can tell how a girl will treat her
husband by the way she treats her brother.
I once knew a young man who asked a girl
to marry him because he saw her tender, loving
solicitude for her brother.</p>

<p>Men like bright girls. Even the most
sober prefer a jolly, laughing girl. As I
once heard a man say about a very merry
one, “Think of having such a creature
always in your home! You wouldn’t have
much chance for blues.” I knew a wonderfully
homely girl who was so jolly that men
surrounded her wherever she went. Men
like a good time, and a lively girl will give
it to them. If you cannot all be jolly, you
can be bright, talkative, and interested. Jolly
girls are never sentimental. A man hates a
sentimental girl. Sentimental looks, long
faces, teary expressions are only attractive
in novels. Men, out of books, do not like<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
to wipe away tears&mdash;they prefer to walk
away from them. Never forget that a man
is a selfish being. Keep that little fact in
view continually; and if you want to please
him, pander to it. If anything will disgust
a man with a girl, it is to see her make a
fuss. Even if you have real heart-sorrow,
the more you control yourself, the more you
will be admired. Remember you look your
very worst when you cry. The tears do
not “well up,” and “overflow,” “chasing
each other down your alabaster cheeks like
so many pearly drops,” as they do in novels.
No: your face squints up, while your eyes
and nose get red. Instead of being attractive,
unless the man for whose benefit you
have gotten up this scene loves you, he will
walk away. It is manlike to walk off at the
first sign of a storm, and to avoid everything
uncomfortable. Bear that in mind. When
you treat a man to a scene on any subject,<span class="pagenum">[25]</span>
you lose your hold upon him. Ten to one
he will leave you to seek the society of some
lively girl who is wise enough to hide her
tears.</p>

<p>A man likes a sensible girl. He likes real
good common sense. Nothing is more trying
than an unreasonable woman, and a man
will not have anything to do with her when
he does not have to do so. He may be
politely pleasant to her, but he does not care
to have her for his wife. To be sure plenty
of unreasonable, trying women are wives.
(I would they were not!) They had the
faculty of hiding their real character before
the binding vows were spoken. It is better
to have nothing to hide. Be your honest
true self always. If you are naturally endowed
with common sense, try to cultivate
it. Learn to be reasonable, and try not to
be governed by your feelings. A man never
cares for a girl whose feelings and not duty<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
are her guide. Bear in mind that I am not
talking about the man who is in love with
you, but the one who views you calmly but
may sometime love you.</p>

<p>Men like good-natured girls. I know
two sisters, the eldest of whom is quick-tempered,
resentful, ill-spoken, and is over
thirty without a gentleman friend. She
never had one. The younger, not yet nineteen,
is good-natured and lively. All the
men who know her like her. One man, in
fear of her being carried off by some one
else, has secured her promise to marry him.</p>

<p>A man likes to feel that the wife he takes
to his home is going to brighten that home.
He does not want a high temper to contend
with. A girl never shows off to a worse
advantage than when she is angry. Men
are attracted by sweetness of disposition.
No greater compliment could be paid to
any woman than is paid to the Princess of<span class="pagenum">[27]</span>
Wales when she is called Her Royal Sweetness.
Directly we hear that, we are drawn
to her.</p>

<p>Sweetness of mind and manner is woman’s
greatest charm. A sweet woman is beloved
by every one. It is woman’s province to be
sweet. Gail Hamilton says, “It is the first
duty of woman to be a lady.” I say, it is
her first duty, after being a Christian (which
is certainly first of everything), to be sweet.
She says to be a lady is more than to be a
prince. Let me add that to be Her Royal
Sweetness is more than to be Her Royal
Highness. We all are won by a sweet manner.
A sweet smile will even draw us to a
stranger. It can be yours if you will cultivate
it. Begin at home. Lay the foundation
there. Be sweet at heart. Do not put
on gracious smiles and winning ways for the
outside world only. If they are not natural,
you will be caught tripping sometimes. Circumstances<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
may arise when you will show
the man whom you are the most anxious to
win what you truly are. Although that
will be a good thing for him, it will be bad
for you. Be genuine. Counterfeit is detected
in the long run. I know a woman
who outside is the very ideal of sweetness,
but who is a perfect demon at home. She
won her husband, whom she now drives
almost to madness, by that assumed sweetness.
In spite of smiles and graciousness,
she is the most friendless woman I know.
The world demands genuine coin, and will
detect counterfeit. So begin at home to be
sweet, and unconsciously it will become your
natural manner. You will not have to
assume it: it will be your own.</p>

<p>A girl may be more than plain, even
homely, but if her manners are gentle, her
voice sweet and low, her bearing womanly,
her power is wonderful. A charming smile<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
unlocks many a door which is barred to a
stiff, ungracious manner. A charming smile
warms every one it greets. It is particularly
winning to a man. It has in it a welcome
which fascinates him, and brings him to you
again. A gracious, sweet manner is of more
account in winning your way with the
sterner sex than millions. More girls are
married for their sweetness than for their
money. A charming, bright greeting, will
sometimes engage a man’s interest or attention
on the spot.</p>

<p>“Be courteous” at all times. “Be courteous”
under all circumstances even the most
trying, in your family, among friends, and
with strangers. I remember it was said of a
sweet girl at school, “She would be polite
to Satan himself if he came to her room.” I
almost believe it. I once heard a truly
sweet girl say, “I was so provoked;” when
another girl broke in, “I don’t believe<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
that. Any one knows that you cannot get
provoked.”</p>

<p>Sensible men like an economical girl. A
man does not want to feel that after marriage
all his money, especially if he does not
have much of it, is going to be wasted.</p>

<p>Men like healthy girls. A man hates to
hear a woman complain. He is not sympathetic.
Men rarely are; but then you must
take them as you find them, not as you
would have them. Just there lies the secret
of some girls’ failure to attract; they have
no patience with a man’s imperfections, and
are unwise enough to allow him to see that
they have discovered them.</p>

<p>Men like girls who are hearty and who
have a hearty interest in things. A real live
girl is always a favorite. A man avoids a
sentimental girl. Do not quote poetry. Do
not look languishing. Do not model your
conduct after the heroines of novels. Study<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
real life, and be real. Do not expect anything
to occur to you as it does to girls in
novels: it never will.</p>

<p>Do not exact too much attention. A
man hates to give it where it is exacted,
even when it is your right. It is their way
to pay it only when they feel like doing so.
A man never wants to be controlled. Before
he is in love, he is particularly alive to any
effort to do so. When he is in love, he is
more blind to it; but even then it is not well
to press it.</p>

<p>To be thoroughly attractive you must
have a great deal of tact. Tact has been
called the supremest weapon in a woman’s
hands. Without it, she is helpless. With it,
she is powerful. Tact will enable you to see
just what to do, how to do it, what to say,
and how to say it. Men are not all alike.
What will please one may not please another.
They are all built on the same general plan,<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
however, and if you know one well, you
know pretty much all there is to be known
about the whole sex. Yet different lines of
conduct are to be pursued with different
men. A girl with tact grasps this in a
moment. Indeed, she grasps the situation
every time and pleases every time. You
must understand man-nature. You can
learn a great deal of it from your brother.
Let me tell you too that if girls would more
frequently advise with their brothers, they
would get along a hundred-fold better. A
brother can give you an insight into other
men, and at the same time look after your
interests. You will rarely fail to go right
and to do right, if you will make him your
confidant. Find out what he likes, and you
will know what other men like.</p>

<p>If you would be attractive, you must hide
your feelings. I know of no time at home
or abroad when it is well to show your real<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
feelings if they are disagreeable. Bear in
mind that I do not lay down a code of laws
to be practised only abroad regardless of
your home-life. Let the first man upon
whom you try your winning arts be your
father. Make him sure that you are the
most perfect of girls. Then try your
brothers. As the most lovely of daughters
and sisters, you will be real when you are
attracting other men by your winning manners.</p>

<p>A man likes a girl who is read up&mdash;at
least in the news of the day. He does not
want to be instructed, and he never likes a
girl who knows better than he does about
things. If even you are sure he is wrong, do
not correct him. That would be a wound to
his vanity, which is itself a fatal thing to do.
If you are better educated than he is, do not
let him know it. Appear to receive instruction,
and let your knowledge be a sort of<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
cushion for his. Be interested in what he
talks about, and willing to learn. Give him
your full attention when he talks to you. It
is a lack of tact that makes a girl show a
want of interest. It is a lack of tact too
that makes a girl let a man see what a good
opinion she has of herself, when she ought
to be showing him what a good opinion she
has of him. It is very well to have it settled
in your own mind just what you are, and
what your attractions are, but do not let any
know of that opinion. It is well to have a
good opinion of yourself: it will give you an
ease in society and a confidence to go ahead
and win. Be sure, however, that you are
worthy of that opinion. Be sure that you
are not deceiving even yourself.</p>

<p>Never allow a man to sacrifice his comfort
for you. If he is rude enough even to ask
to smoke in your presence, with your sweetest
smile give him permission to do so.<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
Promote his comfort in every possible way.
They notice these things and like such attentions.
Do not feel it your right always to
have the best of everything and he the
worst. Decline to accept the sacrifices that
he as a gentleman will insist upon making.
Some girls will heedlessly accept anything
with a sort of blind gross selfishness. The
girl who is unselfish at home, and who looks
out for the comfort of her family before she
does her own, will unconsciously carry the
same winning spirit with her wherever she
goes. The girl who is selfish at home, and
who puts on her sweetness with company
dress, will often forget all about it, especially
under any excitement.</p>

<p>Do not allow a man to spend much money
upon you. He rarely cares to do so, but
does it because it is customary among a certain
class, and thinks that you expect it of
him. Give him a pleasant surprise when he<span class="pagenum">[36]</span>
invites you into a restaurant or elsewhere, by
declining. You do not want to be indebted
to him in a monetary point of view&mdash;it lessens
your dignity. It would not be a pleasant
thing to hear him count up how much
he has spent upon you. A man will do it,
and make remarks about it to other men
too. They have it all done to a fine point,
and know just which girl is expensive in her
tastes, and which one it costs the most to
take out. I have heard them talk when I
have been behind the scenes. Some girls, I
am sorry to say, will even go so far as to hint
that they would like to be taken to a certain
entertainment or out for refreshments. There
is much bitter truth in the jokes we read
about the ice-cream girl. The writer of
them, I always think, has smarted under the
custom.</p>

<p>No matter what a man is himself, he likes
a modest girl. True modesty has a great<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
charm. A girl without it is like a faded
flower. As a general thing, her end is sad.
Beauty is fleeting, but modesty gives a charm
which outlasts youth. A retiring, gentle
girl is something to seek after; and a man
rather seek. A bold girl may receive more
attentions from a certain class of men, but
less love in the long run. That “certain
class of men” you want to avoid instead of
seeking to attract them. The real gentleman,
the kind for whose attentions you care,
never wants anything to do with a bold, loud
girl. The loud girl is never a lady. Cultivate
a low, sweet voice at all times. Abjure
slang and chewing gum. Of the two evils I
do not know which is the worst; but I do
know that no true lady is addicted to
either.</p>

<p>Men like large-minded, large-hearted girls.
They like girls who have no envy in their
nature, who can be fair and just even to a<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
rival, who will see good in every one, and
speak of that instead of the evil.</p>

<p>If you meet a girl whom you feel is your
superior, emulate her; try to become all
she is. At the same time, be large enough
to acknowledge her excellence. Your very
humility and sweet praise of her will be a
winning grace. Ten to one the man will
think how sweet you are instead of seeing
the excellent traits you point out in her.
Bitter, narrow-minded girls have an idea
they can bring a superior girl down to their
level by casting mud at her. It is a species
of mud that always flies back, with a sort of
a double back-action arrangement, and does
all the harm to the thrower. In the first
place, it is not Christ-like to speak unkindly
of any one; in the second, men hate to hear
it. It is only a weak one who will join in
with you. In the third place, it is so small,
and tells so plainly that you are narrow,<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
envious, inferior. Instead of trying to pull
a girl down, always try to climb up beyond
her heights. Be large enough to discern and
acknowledge whatever good you see in any
one. Be charitable to the wrong-doings of
your friends. Never mention the plainly
seen faults of another girl. In this evil
world, be as though you saw no evil. Be
pure. “To the pure all things are pure.”
Let all things and all people be pure in your
sight.</p>

<p>Make yourself worth having, and men will
want to have you. Strive to cultivate a true
womanliness and to become an efficient person.
Be a girl who can help herself, who is
not ignorant of work or too lazy to do it.
Do not be a mere toy whom men will flirt
with and then drop when they want to
marry a woman who will be a helpmeet.
Sensible men do not want to marry a bundle
of nothing for a wife. When they are<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
cheated into doing so, they repent it all
their lives. You do not want to think that
the man whom you will marry is going to
repent the act. I know I would rather die
on my wedding-day. I think that if a man
to whom I was married should hint by word
or deed of such a repentance, I would feel
that my life was a complete failure, and
should want to go out of it then and there.</p>

<p>Be accomplished and brilliant if possible,
but above all things prepare yourself to be a
helpmeet for a man. Men like talents in a
girl, especially music; but a man likes to
have his wife know how to keep house.
Learn that. Learn to make all sorts of garments
and to cook, even if you are wealthy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE GIRL WHO WINS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Being an attractive girl whom all men
like is not exactly the same thing as setting
about deliberately to win some one man’s
heart. It has been said that the girl thinks
of matrimony before the man does. He
goes on blindly and thoughtlessly until he
is so deep in love that he cannot retreat;
while from the very start she thinks whether
or not she would like to wed him.</p>

<p>It may be that you know some young man
whom in a womanly way you would like to
win. Let us suppose that in the secret
recesses of your heart you have decided that
you would like to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>In the first place, you must not fall deeply
in love with him. If you fail, you do not
want to be broken-hearted; and too, when a
girl is really up and down in love, she loses
control of herself. She is no longer sure of
herself and of her conduct. You must keep
cool and calculating. You must admire the
man, and feel that at that time he is the only
one you could love. Lose just enough of
your heart so that, when he is won and asks
for your love, you can give it to him.</p>

<p>You must be able to arrange your mode
of warfare, and always have perfect possession
of yourself. There must be no silly
excitement when he is present, and downcast
face when he is away. Such a course
would surely provoke comment; and your
conduct must not be commented upon. No
one must be allowed to suspect that you are
interested in him. It is not your province
in any way to go a-wooing; but you can<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
work wonders in the way of winning the
man you want. I have read that a woman
may marry whom she will. I almost believe
she can. You cannot, however, go about in
an open way as a man can. With him the
battle is sometimes half won when he makes
it known that he wishes marriage. With you
it would be all lost.</p>

<p>You must never run after a man. Make
yourself so attractive that he will seek you.
Then it is all in your own hands. You can
keep him beside you. You may have to
wait some time for him to come. Be patient.
Nothing is ever accomplished without patience.
An impatient, nervous anxiety on
your part will be likely to spoil everything.
Never go where you know he will be and
where he does not expect you, if you can
avoid doing so. Better, by far, let him miss
you where he anticipates seeing you than
to see too much of you. His disappointment<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
will show him how much he is interested
in you.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to let him see that you
have a modest, maidenly interest in him.
Men like that. It must be done in a retiring
way as if you did not intend to have him
see it, but could not help yourself. While a
man will boast of a girl running after him,
this little secret of yours, which by his acuteness(!)
he has discovered, he will keep sacredly
to himself. The very modesty with
which you try to veil it will heighten its value
in his eyes.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate to let him see by your
greeting that he is welcome. I do not mean
that you are to be effusive. It is done by
your smile, your look, more than by words.
Girls make the mistake of greeting a man
coolly in fear of appearing forward or of
showing a regard. Never be cool to the
man you want to win. Ward McAllister<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
says in his “Society as I Have Found It”:
“The value of a pleasant manner is impossible
to estimate. It is like sunshine; it gladdens.
You feel it, and are at once attracted to the person
without knowing why.”</p>

<p>Young girls are rarely mistress of these
sweet, little, but telling arts. The knowing
just how comes later in life. Balzac has said
that a woman of thirty is at her most fascinating
and dangerous period. The women
who have been the most famous for their
power over hearts have all been nearer forty
than twenty. This seems incredible to you
yet in your teens. You now look upon
twenty-five as a species of old age. At
thirty, you think, as far as men are concerned,
a woman is in the sere and yellow
leaf; while at forty they are little less than in
their dotage. Look out, that while you are
counting on your youth to marry you, some
of these females in the sere and yellow leaf,<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
or even in their dotage, will carry off the
prize, because she knows how and you do
not. The fact is, the woman of thirty is
still young now-a-days, whatever she was in
our grandmothers’ time.</p>

<p>She can win men’s love too. She knows
the world so well that she takes men as she
finds them, while the girl in her teens does
not. The girl aspires too often to make them
fit in her narrow mould. Girls are too often
narrow in their ideas. In the secret acceptance
of a man’s faults, or taking him as you
find him, lies a great deal the secret of power
over them. You girls are too sure of yourselves,
too fixed in your opinions, too certain
that you are right and that others are wrong.
You are too anxious to set a man right.
They have a way of their own of not wanting
to be set right. They never want to be
corrected. If they are wrong, their ignorance
is bliss to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[47]</span></p>

<p>Girls have little charity. They are generally
hard in their judgments of everything
and of everybody. They take delight in
showing off what they know, and making a
man feel like a fool. A man never allows
the same girl to make him feel like a fool
twice. Once is enough for any man. He
seeks the society of another straightway.
Girls are given to display a superiority, and
make a man feel small. Again he walks off.
A man never falls in love with a girl who
makes him feel small. Now the charming
girl hides her own opinions&mdash;her superiority,
and brings out what is best in the man.
This is what you must do every time. When
you seek to win a man, make him pleased
with himself. The better he is pleased with
himself the better he will like you. This is
not done by bold, outspoken flattery (although
a man will swallow larger doses of
that than you suppose), but by adroitly showing<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
him his own best side. If you have to
touch his tender places, do it with a soft
hand that will soothe instead of wound.</p>

<p>A man likes a smart girl. Your smartness
or your brilliancy must, however, be
kept in the background. You must not
use it to dazzle him, but to make him feel
that he is brilliant. If he is witty, never
try to be more so than he is. If he is highly
educated and you are more so, still be willing
to be instructed by him. Never aspire
to teach him. A man does not want to be
set right by a woman.</p>

<p>If he is a talker, so manage that he will
do all the talking, if he wishes to, while you
are the interested listener. I do not mean
that you are to be mum: you are to be so
interested that you cannot help sometimes
breaking in. All your remarks should be to
the point, and so worded that he will be led
on until he is even surprised at his own<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
powers of conversation and brilliancy. There
is no surer way than this to keep him at
your side. If he looks at his watch it will
be to see how much longer he can remain
with you, not because he wishes to hurry
away. When he finally must leave you, he
will have so much better an opinion of himself
that he will be quite a new man. His
thoughts of you will be most flattering. He
will not know why. Men rarely analyze
their emotions. If they did, it would be
worse for us and our little arts. In a certain
way they go about blindly.</p>

<p>A man is self-centred. He loves to talk
about himself. His vanity is his weak point.
If he is no talker, and all other topics fail,
lead him to talk about himself. Only one
man in a hundred will fail to respond to this
bait. He does not know that he is engrossing
the conversation in this way: he only
knows that you are delightful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>The wonderful charm some girls have for
men lies in the interest she shows in him,
and the tact with which she makes him
think well of himself.</p>

<p>A man will not be snubbed. In novels,
especially of the Duchess kind, the abject
small creature whom she calls the hero
thrives upon it. His love feeds upon snubbing,
and grows more intense. He falls in
love at first sight, and the worse his charmer
treats him the more he loves her. This is
not true to life. These books are full of
false ideas, and do much harm to the girl
who reads them.</p>

<p>It seems almost coarse to advise flattery.
Flattery is coarse. You can, however, discover
a man’s good qualities, talents, etc.,
and praise them without limit. Men will
swallow large doses of praise without so
much as a wink. They do not even know
you are praising them; they are only conscious<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
of being pleased. You must be discreet,
however, in giving your doses, and
above all things avoid getting the name of
being a flatterer. You can sometimes give
praise with an unsparing hand, but you must
be sure of the right occasion. A public man
may be praised <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>. In fact, a man
who sings, acts, speaks in public needs it.</p>

<p>The private man wants it too. He gets
less of it from the world in general, and
your good opinion, delicately expressed, will
be all the more acceptable. When you have
a field all to yourself, be sure and improve
the occasion.</p>

<p>The girl who is affectionate wins. I do
not mean to imply that you are to embrace
every man you meet or to allow anything of
the kind from them. You are to show a
certain warmth of feeling. No man likes a
cold girl. Ice repels. A friend of mine,
whose great attraction was her warmth of<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
manner, mowed down hearts like ten-pins
Her greeting always was more than cordial.
She gave almost an affectionate grasp of the
hand, allowing her hand to lie there a mere
shadow of time, while her beaming smile
showed her delight at the meeting. There
was life and warm blood in the touch of her
slender fingers which made many a man’s
heart beat quickly for her. She made a man
feel that in winning her he would be winning
a loving wife, and that is what a man always
wants.</p>

<p>Another equally successful girl made the
man with whom she was talking feel that he
was the only man of much importance in the
world; all her interest was in him&mdash;just in
him. Every look was flattery of the worst
kind.</p>

<p>We sometimes say that a girl has an indescribable
charm and a way with her that no
man can withstand. I think her power is<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
simply that she makes a man think better of
himself. She gives him a confidence in himself.
She makes him pleased with himself.
She shows an interest in his greatest interest,
himself. Instead of wounding his vanity,
which is almost greater than his heart, she
flatters it. Men rarely overlook an insult to
the former. A girl who has made a man
think less of himself may give that man up
on the spot. She is crossed off of his books
forever.</p>

<p>There are occasions when you must exercise
a good deal of forbearance with a man
if you wish to win him. A man is prone to
wander. He may be paying attention to
some other girl when you most want him.
Although it is very annoying, there must be
nothing cold in your greeting when he
comes to you again. You must not reproach
him. You must simply make yourself
a great deal more fascinating than she is.<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
You must be more sweet and winning if
possible than you were before. Take pains
never to speak ill of this possible rival. It
is neither Christian-like or lady-like to do so.
It is bad taste. The man knows you are
jealous. He hates to hear bitter words. It
looks very much as if you could and would
make bitter remarks to your husband. If
you reproach him now for wandering, he
may judge truly that your husband will have
little liberty. If you are jealous and inclined
to make a fuss before there is even any
engagement, what will you be like after
marriage?</p>

<p>If you would win, cultivate a sweet, gentle,
forbearing spirit. Be always gracious. Cultivate
a kindly manner. “Be free from
arrogance, self-assertion, self-consciousness,
considerate of the feelings of others.” Be
courteous and kind in manners to every one.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE GIRL WHO FAILS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>“The young man fights shy of the girl
who makes a dead set after him,” was the
inelegant, but o’er-true paragraph I read in
the paper not long since. The paragraphist
was evidently a man and knew his sex.</p>

<p>The girl who runs after a man fails. She
more likely disgusts him than flatters him.
He does not want her or her attentions
when he can have them without the seeking.
It is man’s province to woo, and his
whole nature seems to revolt against a turning
of the tables. I call to mind a schoolmate
who on this account was a complete
failure. She was pretty, bright, even witty,
well educated, moved in good society, and<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
had money, but no man wanted her. Her
boldness disgusted all of them. When she
saw one she fancied, she paid such open
court to him that he avoided her. Some
time afterwards, when she saw the uselessness
of pursuit there, she turned her attentions
elsewhere, running after another man.
Although naturally attractive, I never knew
a man who wanted her.</p>

<p>I have known of other girls who have
never married for this same reason. It
seems to be a common fault. It is a serious
one. If you are at all inclined to be forward
with men, stop it. You will not only fail
to marry, you will lose respect. You gain
nothing and lose all. You cheapen yourself
and your charms when you “throw yourself
at a man’s head.” As it has been decreed
from the beginning of the world that man is
the head of the woman, so it is decreed that
as he shall protect her, he is the one to woo<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
and she the one to be won. You will meet
coarse men who will respond to all your
advances. They will pay you attention just
for the fun of the thing. They will never
marry you, and it would be a good lesson to
you if you could hear them talk of you
among themselves. A man never spares a
girl who has no respect for herself. A man
whom you run after may even say many
tender things to you. He may lead you up
to the point where, if you had not begun it,
you would have a right to expect him to ask
you to marry him. He doesn’t. He stops
just there.</p>

<p>A girl’s great charm is a sweet, womanly
modesty, which appears to hide a love she
cannot help feeling.</p>

<p>It is a great mistake to let your male
friends see you with any blemishes upon
you. If you have a breaking-out on the
face, a swollen cheek, a red nose, or anything<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
which disfigures you, hide yourself till
it is over. Men like to idealize a girl whom
they admire, and they cannot idealize a
swollen face or a red nose. I knew a girl
who continually had styes on her eyes. She
was not wise enough to hide herself at the
time, but continued to go out where she
would meet her male friends. She has
never married, and I have always thought
that this is the reason. Another girl had
her front teeth drawn, and went about
toothless for a while. Other girls do not
hesitate to let men see them with their
bangs in curl-papers. A man will never let
you see him with his hair not combed or
with his face lathered for shaving.</p>

<p>Be tidy always. Have your hair combed,
your dress neat, even if it is old. Patches
are to be respected, while holes mark the
sloven. Always, even if you are scrubbing
the floor, be ready to see any one who<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
comes. The very one in whose eyes you
most desire to appear well may come then.
Some men have a way of dropping in at
such unexpected times. Many a man has
been disillusionized by a dirty dress or a
frowsy head. Men like a nice appearance.
They never want to marry a sloven if they
know it. A bright and interesting writer
has never married for this reason. Her
head is never combed, and there is always a
rip somewhere in her dress. Her hands are
generally touched off with ink.</p>

<p>The independent, self-reliant girl is rarely
a favorite with men. A man loves to protect.
He does not like a masterful, bossy
girl. He does not want to follow as if he
were a spaniel. It is a poor specimen of a
man who does not want to lead. Three
sisters were left with a very little money at
the death of their father. They were self-reliant
and thorough business women.<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
They invested their money to such good
advantage in real estate that in a few years
they became wealthy women. They were
never married. It would have been impossible
for any man with any self-respect to
have loved either of them: they were so
mannish, independent, and self-reliant.</p>

<p>Do not be of the so-called woman’s rights
order. Men hate strong-minded women
who are forever harping on the wrongs of
women and of the rights they are going to
have. That kind of girl generally does have
a wrong&mdash;the wrong of being neglected by
the sterner sex. A woman’s right is a husband,
a home, and children. It is her right
to have something to love and to make
happy. When she wants to usurp a man’s
place, she is going out of her sphere and
makes a failure of her life. If you have a
leaning towards “woman’s rights,” erect
yourself and lean the other way. If you do<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
not, you are doomed to unattractive spinsterhood,
dress reform, and the lecture platform,
and to feed on husks. That sweet
little wife yonder, who hardly knows who
is being voted for, and whose horizon is
bounded by her husband, is feeding on corn.
She believes that her rights are wifehood
and motherhood, and she has them.</p>

<p>A self-assertive girl fails. A self-assertive,
selfish, self-centred girl is no man’s ideal.
It is unwomanish as well as unwomanly.
A girl who can push ahead and take her
own part is generally allowed to do so. It
is a mistake to be anything that is unfeminine.
Men never admire girls who have
masculine characteristics. Only a fool will
marry her. Do not ape men in dress or
manner. Strive to be womanish and womanly
at all times in every way. The attractive
woman is womanly sweetness personified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[62]</span></p>

<p>The girl who insists upon attentions gets
none. The girl who looks upon her escort
as her slave <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem.</i> loses him. You must
never treat a man as if he were your servant.
He will not stand it from you, although you
may be attractive in other ways. His manhood
will assert itself, and no matter how
much he has loved you, that love will be
killed. It is a poor outlook for married
happiness. He does not care to wed where
he knows he will be henpecked.</p>

<p>A poor girl will marry before a wealthy
one will. The latter has it written upon her
that it costs a mint to keep her. She may
be much admired, but she is an expensive
luxury. Unless a young man has exceptional
means, he must give her up. You
will find numbers of unmarried women in
the highest society everywhere. Men are
afraid to marry the daughters of millionnaires,
unless a large dowry is going to be among<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
the wedding presents. Extravagant habits,
they know, have been her rule. She has
never been taught to economize in anything.
She must have an establishment as
elegant as her father’s. She could not think
of beginning as humbly as <a id="Ref_63" href="#BRef_63">her</a> parents likely
did. So she either fails to marry at all, or
marries late in life, when the death of her
parents has given her an independent fortune.</p>

<p>A girl who shows her anxiety to marry
generally fails to do so. A man feels that
it is marriage and not himself that she wants.
That wounds his vanity. She is never self-possessed
in the society of men. She is so
anxious to please that she plans beforehand
what she will say. When she says it, it
comes out wrong and does not fit in. She
is trembling and eager even if she does not
run after him. Like vaulting ambition, she
o’erleaps herself. Every time you meet
her, she has new and fresh hopes. She is<span class="pagenum">[64]</span>
waiting always anxiously for a proposal, and
would accept any man who offered himself
regardless of creed (almost color), circumstances,
character, and condition.</p>

<p>The sharp, snubby girl never succeeds. A
man will not stay where he is snubbed or
where his vanity is wounded. Some girls,
especially very young ones, have an idea
that they are saying smart things where they
are only saying sharp things. You hardly
realize what a great mistake you are making
when you try to be witty at a man’s expense.
You only make a greater one when you are
cutting in your remarks. Girls have an idea
that it does a young man good to have, as
they express it, “the conceit taken out of
him.” I doubt if it does, and even so, you
are not the one to do it. Let him have a
good opinion of himself in his youth. Help
him to it, rather than to try to take it away
from him. The outside world will give him<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>
knocks enough as he battles his way up in
it, to take any amount of conceit out of him.
Maybe he comes to you sometimes just
smarting from one. Let him find for his
wounds a balm. Learn to soothe and sympathize
instead of hurting. Your tongue is
sometimes so unwittingly cruel. Your laugh
is so heartless that you make a man with a rhinoceros
skin shrink. It all flies back upon
your own head, however. You will suffer
for it afterwards. It will only drive him
from you. Girls often can attract who cannot
keep a beau. Notice them. See if they
have not sharp tongues and do not love to
take the conceit out of a man. “He has
too good an opinion of himself, but I let
him know what I thought of him,” I have
heard girls say. One thing is certain&mdash;if you
have done that, you will never hear from him
that he thinks much of you.</p>

<p>So round off your sharp corners. Remember<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
that the young man with a good opinion
of himself is the more easy to win, because
you can play upon his vanity.</p>

<p>Do not speak your mind plainly. Certain
persons pride themselves on plain speaking,
as if there were a virtue in hurting some one
else’s feelings. When you hear any one say,
“I always speak my mind,” you may know
she says disagreeable things. She thinks
when she has said that that she can go ahead,
cutting right and left with her tongue. They
are never people who praise. It appears
that those who say “just what they think”
generally think unkind things.</p>

<p>Avoid doing so, especially to a man. It is
unkind. It makes more enemies the world
over than anything else. Men will swallow
praise <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad nauseum</i>, but they will not take
censure.</p>

<p>The eccentric girl had better never have
been born, as far as men are concerned.<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
They will have nothing to do with her. If
you are eccentric and have prided yourself
upon it, the sooner you become like folks
the better for you. A man will not pay
attention to an oddity. An outlandish hat
that causes comment will sometimes drive
him away. He may not know what is the
matter with it, but he knows he will not ask
you out while there is any danger of your
wearing it. It is a mistake to be odd in
your conduct or language. Eccentricity
grows upon one. If you are given to it in
your youth, what will you be in your old
age? A man would know that if he were
rash enough to marry you, every day you
would make him ashamed.</p>

<p>The girl who has too many gentlemen
friends hardly ever marries. There is something
in every man’s heart which subscribes
to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“The rose that all are praising,
</div><div class="indent0">Is not the rose for me.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>There are cases where jealousy of another’s
man’s attentions will hasten a proposal. But
two are in the case there, however, and both
are in love. Avoid many gentlemen callers.
Do not allow your house to become a meeting-place.
A man will not fall in love where
he sees you smile as sweetly on another man
as you do upon him. He will reign alone.
He never goes on shares where a heart is
concerned. A man may call often, where
he knows he will meet other men, but it is
only as a friend. He does not fall in love
with his hostess. When he marries it will
likely be some little modest girl who hardly
knows any man but himself.</p>

<p>When I was very young I remember hoping
that when I grew older I would have as
many gentlemen callers as a certain young
lady who lived near us. Every night her
parlors were thronged. It seemed to be a
general meeting-place for young men. Her<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
sister and herself lavished their smiles upon
them. She never married. Her sister married
a man whom she met in another place,
and who hardly ever came to the house.
Another girl had quite as many callers. She
must have seen her danger, for she ceased to
receive them. Some time later she married.</p>

<p>It is flattering to your vanity to have a
great many gentlemen friends who call, and
who take you out, but it will certainly stand
in the way of marriage. It is fun, doubtless,
to count up a long list of escorts, but the
girl who can do so rarely counts up a long
list of offers. A girl who was so retiring
that she was rarely invited out by a gentleman,
was loved by almost every man who
got well-acquainted with her. She could
have counted up a long list of offers but a
short list of escorts. At a party she was a
wall-flower. She had few gentlemen callers,
yet it seems as though all men longed to<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
possess her. She passed most of her evenings
alone with her family, and married well.
So it shows that knowing many men would
rather indicate no marriage than a surety of
one.</p>

<p>The cold girl never succeeds. A man
would as soon make love to an icicle. A
man prefers fire. He likes a warm, living
heart. He wants to see that a girl has that
heart. A pretty, stylish young girl whom I
want to see settled in life is failing to do so
on just that account. She in not naturally
cold, but when she is at all interested in a
man, she becomes almost frigid in his presence.
She is too afraid of showing her
interest in him to allow him to see that she
responds to his. A man wants an affectionate,
warm-hearted wife. So he will marry
what seems to him to be an affectionate girl.
There is a certain warmth of manner that
will show this disposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>A girl fails who will not let the man who
is beginning to love her see that she can
return love. It must be shown modestly,
however. You must be sympathetic. Man
has his success and his failures in life. As
he comes to you, he is thinking of them
more than he is of you. He wants to talk
of them. If you do not show a sympathetic
interest, he will go where he can get it.
Draw him out on his favorite topic, no matter
if it is himself. I remember once
walking two squares with a gentleman who
talked of nothing else but a slight injury on
his hand.</p>

<p>An interesting, intellectual lady is going
through life unmarried for no other reason,
I believe, than her lack of sympathy. You
are conscious of this lack whenever you converse
with her. If you mention yourself,
your humble aim and ambitions, a dead
silence falls. You feel as if you were undone<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
and wish you could hide your head.
A woman will hasten to change the subject
and to make amends. A man leaves and
never returns.</p>

<p>A man likes to look, as it were, in a mirror.
He likes to see himself reflected in
the eyes that meet his. He wants to feel
that the girl has so much interest in him
that she is interested in every word he says
about himself.</p>

<p>The girl who talks about herself usurps
his prerogative. He does not relish that, and
her society is stupid to him. <em>I</em> is a man’s
pronoun. <em>You</em> is a woman’s. Very young
girls who are filled with themselves and their
own affairs are very much given to this. As
they grow older, they see it does not do.
Bear in mind that no matter how pretty you
are or how sweet, if you will talk about
yourself to a man, you become “as tedious
as a twice-told tale vexing the dull ears of a<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
drowsy man.” There is an old witticism
which tells the truth in a nutshell: “What
is a bore? A man who talks about himself
when you want to talk about yourself.”</p>

<p>The high-tempered girl fails. A man
bent upon matrimony avoids her if he is
aware of it. If you have such an infirmity,
try to get rid of it as you would a facial
blemish. Try harder; for it is indeed far
worse than any bodily disfigurement. Our
Lord, whose strength is sufficient for you
always, will help you to do so. Some girls
falsely call it a high spirit. It is anything
but that. It is a weak spirit. A girl who
gives way to temper has no control over herself.
She is weak instead of high and
strong. Her doors are always open, and
whoever will may come in and upset her.
Instead of being proud of it, be ashamed
of it. While possessing it, your life is a
failure everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>A sweet, interesting, lively conversationalist
is one thing, and a girl with a long
tongue is another. Avoid gossip and meddling.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to entertain a gentleman
with an account of your neighbor’s failings
and backslidings. His interests are broader.
He rarely stoops to such little things, and
they weary him. Men never care for girls
who have the reputation for being gossips.
Fill your mind with better things. Read
and enlarge your powers of conversation.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to be inquisitive. While a
man likes a girl to be interested in him and
in his doings, he does not want to be questioned
about them. A walking interrogation
point is never a pleasant companion.
When you draw him out it must be with
tact.</p>

<p>A precise, prim, what we call an old maidish
girl is a failure. She is born to a lonely<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
life of spinsterhood. Unless she change
she cannot escape her fate. At heart she
may be all that is true and good, but no man
will ever find that out. As a rule men judge
of us by outward appearances. They take
women more for what they seem to be than
for what they are. The good qualities of
the prim girl are all lost upon him.</p>

<p>With gentlemen a loud girl never succeeds.
She can always attract the attentions
of coarse men, but a well-bred man
avoids her. He loves modesty. He does
not want the girl whom he escorts to be
conspicuous by boisterous talking and laughing.
He does not want her to be hail-fellow-well-met
with every man they meet. It
shows she has no modesty. He cannot
respect her and will not marry her. It is
never nice to be “gay” or “fast.” The
men whom you attract about you by it are
not the men you want to marry. They are<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
the kind who do not want to marry you or
any one else.</p>

<p>Loud, conspicuous dressing is never an
attraction. Men like stylish, well-dressed
girls, but they never like anything that is
flashy or that attracts attention.</p>

<p>The girl who imagines every man she
meets is in love with her rarely is loved by
one. This is a common fault with young
girls. It comes either from innate silliness
or from the reading of too many novels.
The worst of it is, she is not even cured of
her folly when the men do not propose to
her, but do to some other girl. She imagines
some insurmountable difficulty was in
his way, and that he has only married the
other girl out of pique. That is the way it
was in the last novel she read. Girls, be
sensible. Every man you meet will not fall
in love with you. When one does, he will
let you know it. Men are not given to sighing<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
in secret over one girl, then marrying another
without love. A man who loves you
will be open about it. He will not avoid
you. He acts on the spot: sometimes without
much thought. So when a man does
not pay attention to you, rest assured, unless
you have offended him, that he does not
want to do so. He is not in love with you.
He is more likely to pay attention without
loving, than to love without paying attentions.</p>

<p>A vain girl fails. The pretty girl who depends
altogether upon her looks and is proud
of her beauty, rarely marries. I have spoken
of this before. It has been thought that in
matrimony, as in other fields, the plain-featured
girl has the greatest success. A pretty
girl starts out with false notions of her
charms. She thinks that she has only to be
seen to be loved. She overestimates her one
gift, and does not try to cultivate others.<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
Youths who easily fall in love and as easily
out again are caught by a merely pretty
face. Men want something more.</p>

<p>Let me quote from an article on this subject
which I read the other day: “Look
about you and count the number of faded,
thwarted beauties you know, who are embittered
dependents, or else late in life have
picked up a broken stick in the shape of a
partner to help disguise their crippled vanity.
In fact, so frequently is this the case that between
the ages of sixteen and twenty-six
only extraordinary virtue and talent ever
saves a belle from grievous folly in her
aspirations.” So if you are a beauty and
wish to marry, I advise you strongly to put
aside all vanity, and to cultivate the superior
charms of your plainer sisters.</p>

<p>Never allow your mother to do the courting.
There are times when a girl can win a
man against his will, and he will never know<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>
that it was she who did it. A mother never
can do this. A man knows it every time.
When he sees her efforts, he is forewarned
and on his guard. It is all done in cold
blood and deliberately by the mother. The
daughter has less deliberation and a great
deal of warm blood when she attempts it.
He is likely to think: “What an interesting
girl! I believe I could get her if I tried,”
and may try. Of the mother’s efforts, he
thinks: “That old woman wants me to
marry her daughter. I can see through her.
I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>A mother may make herself so attractive
that, if she were a girl, she would win him.
Notwithstanding that, he hardens his heart
against the daughter. A lady who, even as
a grandmother, is attractive to men, tried in
her early married days to win a young man
for her sister. He responded quickly to her
overtures, and seemed glad to come to the<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
house. She thought she was succeeding,
when one day he said to her: “I know what
you are about. You might as well give it
up, you won’t accomplish it. If you were
not married, however, I would propose to
you to-day.”</p>

<p>She did give it up.</p>

<p>A girl makes a mistake who brags of her
conquests. She should never speak of them
to any one. If a man whom you cannot
accept offers you his hand, forget that he did
so. By your manner to him when you meet
afterwards, endeavor to make him forget it.
The girl who tells about the hearts she has
won, wins no more. Men grow afraid of
her. She is not to be trusted, they think.
If she will lead other men on to propose
only to reject them, then tell of it, she will
do the same to them.</p>

<p>A girl who fears that the man to whom
she only is pleasant will think she is in love<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
with him, is not likely to accomplish much
matrimonially. She grows too self-conscious
and stiff in her manner. You must forget
yourself, or remember only that a man is
won by a pleasant manner. If he did think
you were a bit interested in him, he would
be flattered by it, and might return it
shortly.</p>

<p>By a pleasant manner I do not mean a
continual giggling. While you must be
animated and lively, you cannot laugh continually.
A sensible girl can be grave as
well as gay. There are times, and plenty of
them, when laughter jars. There is certainly
a time to laugh and a time to cry; but there
is never a time to giggle. Solomon gives a
list of almost everything for which we have
time, but he never says a word about giggling.
A bright, animated manner and continual
giggling are two different things. A
bright girl is everywhere a success. A<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
giggler is generally considered half-witted.
A giggler has no depth of feeling. A bright,
lively girl generally has a great deal of feeling;
she is not slow to show it, either.</p>

<p>Do not laugh when you talk. Do not
laugh the moment a man speaks to you,
keeping it up all the time he is with you. It
looks as if you were delighted out of your
senses. Do not laugh every time he looks
at you till he begins to wonder if there is a
black spot on his nose. Some men may
prefer a grave girl any way. You might
study the man and the place before you are
too lively.</p>

<p>It may be that some of you who read
these chapters have failed so far to win any
man’s love. Examine yourself and your
peculiarities to see wherein the trouble lies.
When you have found it, strive to overcome
the difficulty. You cannot do it in your
own strength. The Lord will help you. He<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
will give you grace to overcome every evil
temper, every disagreeable habit, every unlovely
manner. If you ask Him, He will
make you sweet and lovely. Rest assured
that He is interested in your success; for
He did not intend woman to live alone.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SOME UNFAILING METHODS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is universally known that when a man
and woman have a mutual interest, they get
interested in each other. When they are in
any way drawn together, they soon find that
they cannot live apart. When a man grows
accustomed to a woman with whom he is
pleased, he desires to keep her with him.
So we may consider that a companionship
with a man is an unfailing way to win him.
This companionship unfortunately is not
always easy to arrange.</p>

<p>It is often difficult to get up a mutual interest.
When you can, be sure to do so.
It must come naturally however. A forced
arrangement, plainly seen, would defeat
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[85]</span></p>

<p>Marriages frequently take place between
parties who board in the same house. Seeing
each other daily, getting well acquainted,
and the mutual interest, even of the table,
will draw them together. A young lady
boarded, with her brother, in a house where
there were no other young ladies, but a number
of gentlemen. All admired her, several
were smitten with her, and two asked her
hand in marriage. A third began to think
more of her than of the girl to whom he
was engaged.</p>

<p>A widow, with a nice home of her own,
took two clergymen to board. It was not
long before both wanted to marry her. She
did not want either of them, but took the
one who was the most persistent.</p>

<p>Singing together is another mutual interest.
It is the means of many a marriage.
In a quartette, the soprano and tenor marry,
the bass and alto. The singer may marry<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
his accompanist. Jennie Lind married her
unknown pianist, Goldschmidt, who was
younger than herself. Actors, who are
always thrown much together, marry and
unmarry <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i> in a disgraceful way.</p>

<p>The marriage of the type-writer and her
employer is so frequent that it has passed
into a joke. They grow interested in each
other from mere companionship.</p>

<p>A student falls in love with the sister of
his friend where he visits during vacation.
The late Henry Ward Beecher met his wife
at her father’s home whither he had gone
with a college chum, her brother. I had an
aunt who had offers from two students
brought home by her brothers. This is such
a common occurrence that enterprising
mothers sometimes urge sons to bring home
desirable students to introduce to her
daughters.</p>

<p>A lawyer will marry a fair client. I might<span class="pagenum">[87]</span>
add that he is the more likely to do so if he
is settling up a large estate for her.</p>

<p>A physician rarely marries a patient. If
your heart is set upon a certain physician do
not play the rôle of an invalid. When you
are sick you should have a married physician.
A young lady was taken ill with pneumonia.
Her family were strangers in the place, and,
without knowing it, called in an unmarried
physician. He was interested in the case,
but not in the least in her. A year later he
met her, when in perfect health, at the house
of a mutual friend and fell in love with her.</p>

<p>Living next door to each other will often
make young people interested in each other.
Church-work which brings young men and
maidens together is fruitful of many marriages.
A young man was put on a fair-table
with a number of ladies. He fell in
love with the only unmarried one on it. A
young clergyman comes in contact with so<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
many girls, and is so run after, that going to
his church and entering into the work for
his sake is but lost labor. If you want to
work in a Church, do it for the Lord, without
a thought of who has charge of that
body of worshippers.</p>

<p>We learn from Abelard and Heloise what
the pupil will become to the teacher.
Almost always, when neither are married,
free lessons in love accompany another kind
of a lesson&mdash;that is, if the lessons are private.
Men fall in love with a lady who
teaches them anything. A young lady was
taught Hebrew by an unmarried clergyman.
They married about a year after the lessons
began.</p>

<p>A man and woman who are in business
together almost always marry. An author
has been known to marry her publisher. A
Mr. Maxwell published Miss Braddon’s
novels, and now she is Mrs. Maxwell. Margaret<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
Sydney is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</i> of a writer
who married her publisher, Daniel Lothrop,
of Lothrop and Co.</p>

<p>An almost certain way to win a man’s
love is to win his confidence. When a man
talks to a woman about his greatest interest,
he becomes interested in her. When he
opens his whole heart to her, he gives her
that heart. I never knew this to fail. How
to win this confidence is the puzzle. The
very man you want may be the one who
knows the most about keeping his affairs to
himself. You will have to use tact and
patience in drawing him out. Get him to
talk about his business, or make him talk of
his books, his pleasures, his family: always
about himself. Persist in this gently. Show
him you can keep a secret. Encourage him
to talk about himself until he touches upon
something that is nearest his heart. Some
men will do this sooner than others. The<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
man who readily confides in you, readily
falls in love&mdash;and almost as readily falls out.
It is said that the heart which is easily won
is hard to keep; and that the heart which is
hard to win you never lose. When you
have drawn any man to tell you his heart
unreservedly, he is yours.</p>

<p>A young man was in love with a girl of
whom his mother did not approve. He was
much distressed by the fuss she made. He
did not want to give up the girl or to pain
his mother. He must talk of his trouble to
some one, and he selected a young girl who
was visiting the family. He told her all his
troubles. She encouraged him with infinite
tact until he spoke unreservedly. Whenever
he could find her alone he talked of that
and of nothing else. Then he planned to
be alone with her. Before three months he
loved her better than he did the first one.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A WORD OF WARNING.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The greatest mistake a girl can make
is to allow familiarities from men. A girl
must be circumspect in her conduct. She
must be self-respecting. Having a proper
self-respect and being a prude are two different
things. A man never likes a prude.
He never, in his heart, cares for one who
has no self-respect. A man, of a certain
class, will pay her attention and take advantage
of the liberties she allows, but he never
marries her.</p>

<p>You are not safe if you allow the least
digression from the right path. A slip once
made can never be recalled, and the second<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
follows very easily on the first. Then comes
the third, and so on, till ruin is the end for
you&mdash;not for him.</p>

<p>It is a girl’s own fault if she fall. It is
her place to guard her honor.</p>

<p>You will meet many a man who is lover-like
and fascinating, but if he says nothing
about marriage, leave him alone. You do
not want to hear of love, if that is all he has
to say. Never mind if you do love him.
If he loves you and finds he cannot possess
you otherwise, he will want to marry you.</p>

<p>Beware of the beginning. Be careful of
your conversation. Never smile at a joke
with a double meaning. Meet it with silence.
Do not pretend you do not understand
if you do: there are men who would
take pleasure in enlightening you. There
are times when it is well to show that you
do not approve of it; you may even have
to rebuke it. Thereafter avoid that man.<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
If he cares to continue your friendship, he
will know how he must behave himself.</p>

<p>Never let a young man repeat a story to
you that he would not repeat if your mother
were present. A man who would do that,
means no good to you. An old and excellent
rule is, never talk about anything to
a man you would not talk about before
a third party; and never talk to a girl as
you would not talk if a man were present.
Never say anything to either which you
would not repeat to your mother. A well-known
writer has lately said: “It is always
a mistake for a young girl to talk to a man
as if she were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> and widely experienced
in all human emotions, frailties, and faults.
Many inexperienced, innocent girls adopt
this manner, thinking it will render them
fascinating in the eyes of men. Men take
us for what we seem, not for what we are.
The most hardened <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mondaine</i> who wears a<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
mask of frank innocence fares better with
them than the good, sweet-hearted girl who
puts on <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">blasé</i> airs and pretends to be a little
wicked.”</p>

<p>Let your heart be pure. Keep your lips
pure. God can make and keep them so.
He can take away all interest in sin.</p>

<p>Never make an appointment with a
young man of which you cannot tell your
mother. When a young man urges you to
deceive your mother, he means to deceive
you. Your mother is your best friend;
make her your confidante in all things, then
you will never go astray. On the first approach
of familiarities, consult her and be
guided by her advice.</p>

<p>Men do not have to be told: they know
what girl they may approach familiarly and
what one they must treat with respect. You
may be sure there is something wrong in
your conduct if you are approached as you
do not wish to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[95]</span></p>

<p>Be careful not to call a man by his first
name unless he is a relative. A well-bred
lady will not even address a man thus whom
she has known in her childhood. Do not
allow a man to call you by your first name.
You can easily show by your manner that it
is distasteful to you. Check even the liberty
of your Christian name with the prefix Miss.
Although you may have an older sister, you
have a right to your father’s name. If you
cannot be Miss Jones, you can be Miss
Mary Jones.</p>

<p>When you are out walking with a gentleman,
do not allow him to grasp your elbow.
Some men do this instead of offering the
arm. He is ill-bred if he attempts it. It is
too familiar altogether, and is becoming too
common. A polished gentleman will not
do it. He will offer his arm.</p>

<p>Beware of allowing a caress from a man
to whom you are not engaged. Stifle in<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
the beginning any attempt to do so. Do
not so much as allow him to hold your
hand. No matter if you do like him, and
if his warm grasp does send the happy
blood to your heart, it is a happiness
you have no right to&mdash;neither has he, until
he has spoken. Sometimes these things,
small as they seem, are but the first step on
the broad path that leads to destruction.
Perhaps you like as much to feel that strong
arm about you as he does to put it there. It
is in his power to make it right to do so; it is
not in yours, so refuse it. Believe me, you
will gain nothing by it, and may lose all. If
a man finds he cannot embrace you unengaged,
he will take steps to be engaged to
you if he loves you.</p>

<p>Poor child! You allow it because you
love him. It may be anything but love for
you and your good that prompts his action.
A man rarely binds himself to a girl who<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
allows his caresses without it. Another
thing, while you are treasuring up this caress
as a closely-guarded secret, he is doubtlessly
telling his comrades what liberties be can
take with you. That is too true. The indiscretions
which a girl will hide, he will
boast of&mdash;it is a man’s nature. He judges
you by himself, too. He knows that he
kisses other girls when he can get a chance,
and he supposes that you allow other men’s
caresses. A man cares more for the caress
than for the girl. When he is not genuinely
in love, one girl will do almost as well as another.
He supposes it is the same with you.
He argues that if you are cheap to him, you
will be cheap to other men.</p>

<p>“Never speak of love till your lover
speaks of marriage,” is a good old rule.
Men do not talk much about marriage to a
girl who will profess her love before he asks
her to be his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>Be careful to whom you give your photograph.
Like figures, they cannot lie. If
you have given it, you cannot deny doing
so: it is there, a fact, in the young man’s
possession&mdash;he may show it to whom he
pleases. He generally pleases to show it to
all his male friends. It is another thing
which cheapens you. Your picture is one
of a collection he has of girls. Maybe for a
while, when exhibiting his gallery of beauties,
he may call you his best girl. He does
it all lightly, and as the young men look
over the collection, they will make remarks
about you all which, if you heard them,
would make you blush. If a girl has no
more respect for herself than to give a
picture to every man who asks for it, you
must not expect men to respect her. It is
no sign a man loves you because he asks for
your picture. If he does, let him ask for
you first. He more likely wants to enlarge<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
his collection of photographs. If you went
into his room, you would see it stuck up in
his mirror with a dozen or so of others.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to imagine that an engagement
breaks down all barriers. Engagements
are so frequently broken. Instead of
being almost as sacred as marriage, they are
held lightly. You must continue after your
engagement to be careful of your conduct
and not to allow any undue liberties. Do
not let your lover’s caresses be too frequent
or passionate. Some young people
act as if they only become engaged so they
might kiss each other&mdash;they spend all their
time at it when they are alone. Some of
these things are sweeter if they are waited
for. Couples who are parted during their
engagement generally are the most happy
when they are married. They have not
exhausted their affection; instead of its being
an old story, it is fresh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>If it were worth the while, I would advise
you not to sit on a man’s lap till you were
his wife. It is quite customary with lovers,
I know; but it seems to me to be letting
down bars which should be left up. Engagements
are so easily broken that there should
be stricter lines drawn. Surely no true
woman who has entered upon her second
engagement wants to remember how she
sat on the lap of the first betrothed. While
there is no harm in so doing, you will be on
the safe side not to.</p>

<p>It is wrong to take money from your
betrothed. If you live on dry crusts and
work till you drop, refuse it. Be married in
calico rather than have his money buy your
wedding-dress. Sometimes girls will urge a
speedy wedding-day. You have no more
right to do that than you have to ask him
to marry you&mdash;the two go together. If he
is too slow and you know of no reason why<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
he should be, he does not care much for
you; you had better break the engagement.
However, if your heart would break with
the engagement, try to make him more
anxious to have you all to himself. It is not
a girl’s place to be eager for the marriage.
If you are self-supporting and want to marry
him because you are tired of working, you
wrong him. No matter what reason you
may have for wishing an early marriage, it is
never your right to propose it.</p>

<p>Attentions from a married man are blasting
to a girl’s reputation. No matter how
fascinating he is, how much you admire him,
how much you like his attentions, refuse to
accept them. He is desecrating the most
sacred ordinance, marriage. He is insulting
you and wronging his wife. Eventually he
will return to her, leaving you with a tarnished
name. His wife will forgive him, and
society will forget he went astray; but his<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
wife will never forgive you, and society will
never forget it. You will always be spoken
of as the girl that was “crazy after him.”
It will stand in the way of a marriage for
you. Men do not care to marry a girl who
has been talked about, or whose name was
coupled with a married man’s. You lose
everything by it, almost your character.
There is no such food for gossip as the attentions
of a married man to a girl. They suspect
you are not all you ought to be, they
have good reason to do so. They may think
if you will encourage a man to trample on
his marriage vows, you would trample on
your own. You are condemned by every
one.</p>

<p>Your vanity may lead you to feel a degree
of triumph in winning a husband from
a wife. It is no triumph, however, to do so.
The man who will be so won is in most
cases extremely weak and decidedly untrue.<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
It is not that your attractions are superior
to hers, it is that he is fickle, and you were
the first girl who accepts his unlawful love.
Instead of being a triumph, it is a sin. Instead
of being a subject for boasting, it is
something to be ashamed of. Instead of encouraging
him for one moment, flee from
him. Instead of looking upon him as your
lover, consider him your worst enemy: an
enemy who for the selfish indulgence of the
time would ruin your whole life. In this
world of sin and sorrowful consequences of
sin, you cannot be too careful of yourself,
your conduct, and your associates. If a man
is known by the company he keeps, much
more is a girl. Much misery will come from
one imprudent, maybe innocent, act. A
trifle may sometimes be what starts you on
the road to destruction. That road is broad,
and very enticing to some; but the end is
death. Never drink with a man. The pity<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
of it that this should have to be written
down! There is a class of girls who aim to
be a little fast. They think they make themselves
attractive to men by keeping pace
with all their sins. They think men will
like them if they have a “good time” with
them. They call this a “good time.” It is
an unmitigated bad time; a time that will
make you and him bad too. You will fail
in your object, for you will not attract him.
It is a low man who will care for a girl who
cares so little for herself.</p>

<p>Instead of drinking with a man, keep him
from doing so. Your power over men is
very great, girls; it is much greater than
you think. You can make him good or
bad, if he loves you. If he is only your
friend, you can help him withstand temptation
and turn him from wrong. Try to exhibit
the ideal woman always. Let your
character be so elevated that you will raise<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
the man who walks beside you. Be a pure,
true girl, and he will be a better, purer man.
The very thought of you, as he goes out
into a sinful world and meets temptations of
which you are ignorant, will be a shield to him.
Next to the strength God can give him, will
be the remembrance of your goodness and
purity. He will, for your sake, abhor things
which before had a fascination for him.</p>

<p>Always be wrapt in a cloak of sweet
maidenly reserve and dignity. Then no
tongue can assail you, no man will dare to
offer you any familiarity; the conversation
and conduct of men will take a better tone
in your society.</p>

<p>Try to make every man you meet, even a
passing acquaintance, better. Resolve that
you will know no man whom you will not
influence decidedly for good. So act that
when you look back in after years you
can honestly say that you tried to make<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
every man whom you knew well, a Christian.
So strive to lead young men to Christ that
you will see the fruits of your efforts dotted
all along your path of life. Let every man
whom you know be able to say, as he looks
back, “I have been a better man for knowing
her.”</p>

<p>In all your intercourse with men, do everything
to ennoble and nothing to lower his
character. “Let him see that you are a
true woman and a Christian: one whose life
is beautiful in its maidenly dignity and attractive
loveliness.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE SECRET OF THE WIDOW’S POWER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>There is no doubt that a widow can, if
she choose, attract a man where a girl is
powerless to do so. She has a charm which
is irresistible when she pleases to exercise it.
This power lies greatly in her knowledge of
man-nature. It lies also in her taking a
man just as he is. Instead of wounding his
vanity by trying to make him conform to
her ideas, she makes him pleased with himself
as he is. Girls have sharp corners
which hurt a man if he runs against them;
widows never have. Girls are unkind;
widows never are. Girls like to tease and
ridicule a man; a widow is too wise to do
so. Girls will wound even a man who is
not sensitive; a widow soothes. Girls<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
never remember a man’s feelings; a widow
never forgets them.</p>

<p>She has studied one man thoroughly.
She knows his peculiarities, his weaknesses,
his strong points, his likes and dislikes. In
knowing one man well, she knows his sex.
She has learned well what will please one
man. In learning that she knows what will
please all men. She has learned to sink her
own individuality. She has learned to follow,
and has no desire to lead. She knows
that men like to be obeyed. She knows
they like their ease. She knows they would
rather be amused, entertained, than to dance
attendance. She knows that the best way
to entertain a man is to make him talk of
himself or his hobby. She never minds
how much he rides this hobby when he is
with her. A girl would forbid its entrance.
A widow may even get up and ride with
him. When a girl would show a man she<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
has no interest in his affairs, a widow would
make him believe she was even more interested
than he was. A girl would say, “I
get so sick of hearing that man talk on that
subject that I won’t listen to him.” The
widow draws him out. Where a girl would
cut him short, she encourages him to go on
at length. He begins to connect her with
his hobby. He learns to come eagerly to
her with every new development, sure of
sympathy. When he is downcast about it,
he comes to her as quickly for the encouragement
he is sure to get. He begins to feel
that there is no one in the world who understands
and appreciates him as she does. The
rest soon follows.</p>

<p>A widow is sympathetic&mdash;she is sincere
in that sympathy. She has suffered and
feels for all who suffer. She can understand
a heartache, because she knows what it is to
have her dearest earthly hopes shattered.<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>
Her life is a disappointment, and she can
weep with those who have been disappointed.
She has found out that life is not a bed of
roses only, but has many thorns. She will
help soothe the wounds that thorns have
made in other hearts. She knows that men
have troubles, little or great; and she knows
too much to give him any more. She has
stood by one man as he has fought with the
world, and knows that it is woman’s province
to strengthen him by her sympathy and
helpful word for the battle. She knows that
when a man seeks a woman’s society he
wants peace. She knows his vanity is
wounded every day in his contact with men,
and that when he comes to her he wants it
flattered.</p>

<p>So a widow tries to make a man happy
and comfortable. She rarely alludes to her
own grief. It is more interesting because
she does not. She mutely appeals for sympathy,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
while she gives that same sympathy.
Few young girls know anything about sorrow;
they cannot understand what it is.
They are generally so full of themselves they
cannot sympathize. Herein lies their weakness,
and herein lies a widow’s strength.
Sympathy is a woman’s greatest power.
Girls are self-centred; a widow never is.
A girl is absorbed in her own pleasure; a
widow has learned to make the pleasures of
another hers. A girl puts herself forward
prominently; a widow sinks her personality.
She has learned to do so. She knows
the man with whom she is talking is more
interested in himself than he is in her. She
knows that no man cares as much for her
interests, plans, hopes, as he does for his
own; and she talks of his only. She lets
him take the lead in the conversation, she
follows.</p>

<p>A young girl has moods; a widow has<span class="pagenum">[112]</span>
none. She is always the same. A man is
sure of her. He knows when he leaves her,
she will be the same when he meets her
again. I have known girls to lose an
admirer by a cool greeting or change of
demeanor. A widow never would. It is
said that Madame Recamier’s great charm
was her gracious sweetness, which was under
all circumstances the same.</p>

<p>A girl fancies that a man thinks of her all
the time, as she does of him. She likely
thinks of him all day and dreams of him by
night. A man, out in the world, is engrossed
in business&mdash;that is his first consideration.
It is only his leisure he can give
to her. He goes to her for his pleasure.
A widow knows this. She has other things
to occupy her mind, and comes as fresh to
him as he does to her. She knows that he
has not lived over and over her last remarks,
and she has not dwelt upon his. She makes<span class="pagenum">[113]</span>
no mistakes in estimating his affection for
her.</p>

<p>She never puts his affection to a test.
Girls love to do so. A widow knows that it
will have to be a pretty strong one that will
stand it. She never makes any experiments.
She knows him in and out. She knows
what will please him and what will not
please him. She knows what flatters his
vanity and what will drive him away. Her
lessons have been too thorough to allow any
mistake.</p>

<p>Experience has taught her that the best
way to win a man is to make him think
more of himself. Experience has taught her
that she can have her own way easily by
proper management. A girl fights openly
for her own way. She is unsuccessful as
her plans are open.</p>

<p>A widow knows that the royal road to a
man’s heart lies through his stomach. Her<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
little dinners and tempting lunches are a
part of her mode of warfare. A man will
always go where he can get a good dinner.
He does not wait for a second invitation,
and hardly a first. A man is always pleased
with himself (unless he is a bad case of
dyspepsia) when he has a good dinner.
When he is pleased with himself, he is
pleased with those about him.</p>

<p>When a man knows that an evening call
means a pretty little lunch, he is quite sure
to come again. He goes first for the sake
of his stomach, and later for the sake of his
heart.</p>

<p>A widow never forgets that the better
friends she and the man become, the more
likely he is to love her. With a man and
woman there is but a short step from friendship
to love. It has been said that there is
no such thing as Platonic friendships between
the two sexes. A widow knows that<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
friendship ripens more quickly over the well-laden
table than under any other circumstances.
A girl trusts to romantic surroundings.
A widow never does. She has found
out that her hero was fleshly, and she knows
that all men are. She knows that only a
boy, wildly in love, prefers moonlight to a
substantial meal.</p>

<p>If a girl takes a meal with a man it is always
at his expense. A widow never allows
a man to spend much, if any, money upon
her. She knows just how little he cares
about doing so. She has heard the opinion
of one man strongly expressed on that subject.
She will not put one stumbling-block
in a man’s way.</p>

<p>A widow knows how to dress. She
knows just the kind of dresses a man likes.
She rarely is given to display. She chooses
quiet tones or continues to wear black.
Costly apparel she is well aware will frighten<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
away a man of limited means. She studies
herself, and how to dress, so as to make the
best of both. Her art is so perfect that it is
hidden.</p>

<p>A widow is in no haste to wed. Many
do not wish to do so at any time. She does
not have to marry for a home: she either
has inherited one or is able to support herself.
She has no fear before her eyes of being
an old maid. Years do not lessen her
chances, as they do a girl’s. She does not
pretend to be young. Youth is not her attraction.
In these respects she is as independent
as a man. It is not matrimony
alone she cares for, if she marries, but a congenial
companion. If she does not meet the
right one this year, she may the next. She
can afford to wait.</p>

<p>A widow is conscious of her power. That
gives her a good command of herself. She
knows, from one man at least, if not from<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
more, the full value of her charms. She
knows her power to retain one man’s love
even until the end. She knows how to
make a man happy. She has done so. She
knows that what once won love will do so
again. She knows a man’s weak points:
she knows his strong ones. She knows her
own weak points: she may have been told
of them very plainly. These she takes pains
to strengthen.</p>

<p>Old bachelors are proverbially hard to win.
When one does marry it is almost always a
widow. She only seems to know how to
attract him. She knows what a hard fight it
will be, and sets deliberately about doing it.
She knows he is selfish. Only a selfish man
tries to avoid family ties and troubles.
Your warm-hearted, unselfish men always
marry. A widow is not shocked at his selfishness.
She has not looked for perfection.
She helps him be selfish. She makes him<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
look upon her as one who will encourage his pet
foibles. She shows him that she will help him
with them; instead of having to give up for her
“my dog and my cat,” she will pet “my dog and
my cat.”</p>

<p>Yet a widow has a great drawback. There
are some men at whom she can never get a chance.
A man who does not wish to marry avoids a
widow. He will pay attention to a young girl
perfectly sure he can withstand her charms; but
the young widow is a different person. He knows
that if he allows himself to begin there, he cannot
break off. Dickens gave the key-note to the
whole situation when he said, “Samivel, beware
of the widders.” For ages Samivels who do not
wish to marry have obeyed that injunction.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“LADY BEAUTY.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The following is quoted, verbatim, from
an English novel entitled, “Lady Beauty;
or, Charming to Her Latest Day.” As it bears
upon this subject, and many may not have
read the book, I copy some parts.</p>

<p>“You will find that your own enjoyment
is heightened by the consciousness of power
to please others.... Let this ever be in
your mind: ‘I am a creature formed to give
pleasure.’ Be courteous, be gentle, be refined,
be sweet in all your dealings. Never
lose your temper: it ruins the face; and it
always leaves a disagreeable impression
which nothing rubs out. Depend upon it,
men may respect those creatures who are<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
called women of character, which generally
means women who perform awkwardly duties
which with a little thought they might perform
in a charming way: men may respect
them, but when they want enjoyment they
turn to women who study the art of pleasing.
Now, what I want to teach you is, to be
solid and pleasing too. Believe me a woman
is seldom called upon to do anything which
she may not do in an agreeable style if she
will only take pains.... Never disarrange
for an instant the drapery of pleasantness
which a woman ought always to wear: keep
it on you even for your husbands.... Be
agreeable even when you are alone with your
looking-glass. Please everybody as far as
you can. Study morning, noon, and night
to be agreeable.</p>

<p>“Don’t expect too much of men and
women, and you will learn to be good-humored
over their selfishness and hypocrisy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>“Learned talk is very affected. Be as
well-educated as you please, but don’t seem
so.</p>

<p>“She had a frank, spontaneous sympathy
with life all around and in every part, such
as I never met in any one beside herself.
By reason of this virtue she was always interested
in what was going on, and the very
quality which subdued her individuality in
one way made her character fresh and delightful
in another. She resolved to charm
others with happiness and goodness in view,
not mere society conquests.... She used
worldly methods for most unworldly means.
The polish, the graces, the social attractions,
the accomplishments, literature, and wit,
which some despise, she used as the very
material out of which her noble purpose
must be woven.... In the secret interior
of her intentions she was truly devoted, trying
by the spell of a beautiful womanhood<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
to make those with whom she lived better
and happier.</p>

<p>“‘Tell me about it,’ she whispers, oh so
low, so deliciously. She meant, ‘Anything
you say will be sweet to hear.’</p>

<p>“Too womanly for coquetry or coyness,
she gave her answer at once.</p>

<p>“Warmth, purity, tenderness, principle,
all the finer parts of character were hers....
Her face was beautiful because it was the
image of the soul.</p>

<p>“It is a good maxim: ‘Never really be
angry.’</p>

<p>“To the opposite, her sister relied on her
beauty for a place among her sex, and was
at no pains to cultivate conversation, letters,
or any branch of the art of pleasing except
the setting forth of her personal charms.
Had her manner and her talk been what she
might easily have made them, she would
have shone out as a beauty in the prime of<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
her womanhood. She had no lack of sense
nor of education, either; but proudly reposing
on her incontestable loveliness, she rather
withdrew than put forward her attractions.</p>

<p>“I wish to convince women that it is a
great mistake on their part to suppose that
their power to please departs with youth.
At all times I have noticed that men of
sense seldom admire&mdash;or grow enamored of&mdash;women
for beauty alone, but for character,
manner, taste, and conversation. Now, while
beauty, we must admit, lessens with time,
character, manner, taste, and conversation
may each be refined and enriched....
Mere beauty is but one bright unchanging
beam: it will even grow wearisome; but
wit, sense, courtesy, and humanity are forever
casting forth new and unexpected rays
and enlivening intercourse with agreeable
surprises.</p>

<p>“She was the best dresser I ever knew.<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
Her appearance pleased numbers of people
before they saw her face.... She managed
through all the changes of fashion to respect
herself and her own figure and face: in the
fashion she would always be; but still she
would modulate it so as to be the queen and
not the slave.</p>

<p>“Her manners in society were captivating.
With what graceful attention she heard
what you had to say. How modestly she
gave her own opinion.... She tried to
please. She knew that a woman ought to
be an object of admiration and affection,
and she ruled her whole life with a view to
this fact. Her religion gave a richness, a
sweetness, a seriousness to all her charms.</p>

<p>“You will laugh when I tell you that
Lady Beauty at the age of fifty-three had a
new lover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>


<h3>“<span class="smcap">Beauty Rules.</span>”</h3>

<p>“Rule One.&mdash;A woman’s power in the
world is measured by her power to please.
Whatever she will wish to accomplish, she
will manage it best by pleasing. A woman’s
grand social aim should be to please.</p>

<p>“Rule Two.&mdash;Modesty is the ground on
which all a woman’s charms appear to the
best advantage. In manner, dress, conversation,
remember always that modesty must
not be forgotten.... Not prudery. Modesty
is of the soul. Prudery is on the surface.</p>

<p>“Rule Three.&mdash;So the woman’s aim is to
please, and modesty is the first principle.</p>

<p>“Rule Four.&mdash;Always dress up to your
age or a little beyond it. Let your face be
the youngest thing about you, not the
oldest.</p>

<p>“Rule Five.&mdash;Remember that what<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
women admire in themselves is seldom what
men admire in them.</p>

<p>“Rule Six.&mdash;Women’s beauties are seldom
men’s beauties.</p>

<p>“Rule Seven.&mdash;Gayety tempered by seriousness
is the happiest manner in society.</p>

<p>“Rule Eight.&mdash;Always speak low.</p>

<p>“Rule Nine.&mdash;A plain woman can never
be pretty. She can always be fascinating if
she takes pains. I remember well a man
who was a great admirer of our sex telling
me that one of the most fascinating women
he ever knew was not only not pretty, but as
to her face decidedly plain. ‘Her figure,’ he
said, ‘was neat, her dressing faultless, her
every movement graceful; her conversation
was clever and animated, and she always
tried to please. She was one of the most
acceptable women in society I ever knew.
She married brilliantly.</p>

<p>“Rule Ten.&mdash;Every year a woman lives,<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>
the more pains she must take with her
dress.</p>

<p>“Rule Eleven.&mdash;In all things, let a woman
ask what will please a man of sense before
she asks what will please the men of fashion.
You see, if a woman lives for the commendation
of men of fashion, she will, if pretty,
piquant, or what not, have a reign of ten
years. But if she remembers that she has
charms of mind and character and taste, as
well as charms of figure and complexion, the
men of sense will follow her for a half century;
and in the long run the men of fashion
will be led by the men of sense.</p>

<p>“I have often asked myself, ‘What is the
secret of her character?’ and I have always
come to the same conclusion: that if her
religious faith were deducted from her, she
would not be what she is, but must become
a less agreeable and not so good a woman.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE LOVED WIFE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Our life-story does not end, as it does in
the novel, when the wedding-bells ring.
After that comes the real life. The wedding-bells
are but the call to more faithful
duties, more earnest, unselfish love, greater
effort to be attractive, more pains to make
the husband happy than were taken to win
his love. They ring out the birth of a love
that is until death. They ring out the knell
of all coyness and romance. The hero becomes
the very human man: the shy girl is
a woman who is to be his helpmeet. They
ring out the beginning of a battle where
man and woman must stand shoulder to<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
shoulder if they would win. They tell of a
conflict where there will be strength in
union, but in division weakness, destruction
of happiness, complete failure, disgrace, and
sometimes even death.</p>

<p>A girl rarely considers the deep responsibilities
she takes upon herself when she marries.
She is more often thinking of the
happiness it will give her than of what she
is to be to the man. She does not stop to
think whether or not she is going to make
her husband happy. She forgets that from
that time his whole happiness, his success in
life, almost his soul, are in her keeping. “A
man must ask his wife’s leave to thrive” is
altogether true. A wife may be a dead
weight or an inspiration. The dead weight
drags even the strongest down, and an inspiration
helps him to conquer every time.
I have heard a man with a bad wife say:
“Oh, I have no heart in me to do anything.<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
She takes it all out of me.” I have known
a man with less ability, but with a true wife
to inspire him, to conquer where the other
failed.</p>

<p>Marriage itself is not happiness unalloyed.
Life never is in any state. You are happier
married than single, but marriage has its
hard places. The romance soon dies out.
Real life comes. The every day living together
brings friction. It is for better and
for worse. It seems a light thing to say at
the time when you are sure it will all be for
the better. You fancy you have only half
learned his goodness. In many cases that is
so. In many more it is not: it is for the
worse. Then the break comes. Gradually
his weaknesses will be revealed to you. The
golden idol shows clay feet. Slowly the
gilding is all rubbed off, and the idol is seen
to be clay all through. Many a woman
meets with this disappointment. It is the<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
great disappointment of her life. God help
the woman who finds that her husband is
unworthy of her love! A weak woman sinks
under the blow, and drags him even farther
down. A strong woman will stand up
bravely and in the end draw him up to her
heights.</p>

<p>She must gather together all her love for
him. She must allow religion to take the
helm with this love or all is lost. Sometimes
love reels: sometimes the senses do.
Then, of all times, a woman must watch
herself well. She is fighting a terrible battle
with her disappointment as well as with his
faults. They must be silent battles: the
more silent the stronger they will be, and
the more sure she will be of victory. She
must never by hint or word let any one outside
know of his failings. If they are of the
kind which go before or which are well
known by the community, she must show<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
the world that she is blind to them. She
must never speak against her husband even
to her own mother. She must never admit
that he has a fault. She has entered into a
partnership where one partner cannot be
untrue to the other. She has promised before
God to honor him. Her loyalty may
save him. It is certain that if she does talk
about him, and it comes to his ears, it will
drive him away from her. When a breach
is made between husband and wife, it widens
continually. What in the beginning is a
tiny thread soon becomes a broad gulf. It
is really wonderful what a little while it
takes for this breach to widen, and how disastrous
are the effects. Our daily papers
are a continual illustration of that fact.</p>

<p>A perfect wife will never allow her opinion
of her unworthy husband to be known.
If he is unkind to her, she hides it as she
hides her own misdeeds. Indeed, she would<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
rather take upon herself the blame for any
trouble others may have seen. She is
pleased always with any kind attention he
receives. A lady wrote her sister, with
whom her husband was stopping for a few
days: “He writes me you are doing every
thing to make his visit pleasant. Thank
you. Whatever kindness you bestow upon
him you bestow upon me.”</p>

<p>You will find plenty of listeners when you
tell of your husband’s faults and your own
wrongs. They will be your apparent sympathizers.
Not one, however, will respect
you for doing so. No one will care about
you. Almost all will repeat it to some one
else. It will be generally said that you live
unhappily with your husband. You will
have as much blame as he has. It is the
way of the world. It knows pretty well
that the wife who so far forgets herself as to<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
talk against her husband is as much to
blame for the trouble as he is. She cannot
be a good, loving, Christian wife, who is trying
to lead him to better things. Such a
woman would hold her tongue. In telling,
you have simply opened all the doors and
windows of your house and invited the community
to look their fill at your most private
affairs. The rest of the doors and windows
of the community are closed. You have
noticed&mdash;have you not?&mdash;that your confidence
has not been returned. No, indeed.
It is well known that the woman who cannot
guard her husband’s honor cannot respect
another’s confidence. If only in the
sight of men then, the untrue wife is the
loser. She sends him into greater wrong.
She undoes herself as she undoes him.
Together they must rise or fall. Many a
woman in her blind anger at her husband<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
has tried to crush him. Like Samson, when
he would crush the Philistines, she has succeeded,
but only to bury herself in the ruins
with him.</p>

<p>That her husband is not what she thought
him, is no excuse: she took him for worse
as well as better. She is simply showing
that she is not one whit above him, and
that he has been decidedly deceived in her.
He has gotten the worse too.</p>

<p>Unfortunately true, good men have bad
wives, too&mdash;they are not confined to bad
husbands only. There are wives of good
men who forget that the husband’s whole
happiness depends upon them. Many a wife
forgets this great responsibility. His business
may be successful and everything outside
going along satisfactorily, but if he has
no peace at home he has no happiness. A
woman who does not make her husband<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
happy fails in her great life-work. She is
unworthy to be the mother of his children.
God gave woman to man to be his helpmeet;
she is no helpmeet if she makes his
life wretched. It is her highest pleasure,
her great “rights,” to smooth his path. If
she fail there, she far better never have married.</p>

<p>What a man wants in his wife is companionship,
sympathy, and love. He wants
to feel that she is his best friend. He never
wants to look anywhere else for sympathy
and help: he never will if he can get all
he needs from her. His life has many hard
places: he needs a companion to go over
them with him. He is often overtaken by
misfortunes: he needs some one to stand
by him and sympathize as she helps him to
bear them. He has to fight with poverty
often, and he needs a woman whom he feels,<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
when he puts his arms about her, is worth
fighting for. He has many enemies: he
needs a wife whose loving words will make
up for the bitter ones he hears from them.
He needs a wife who will make him forget,
when he is in her presence, that there is an
unkind world outside. He meets sin everywhere:
he wants a wife who will give him
words of counsel, and who will take his
hands and lead him to greater faith in, and
love for, the Father. Storms will come all
through life, he must encounter them.
He needs a woman who will cling to him
through the hardest. He needs her love
through sunshine and victory as well.</p>

<p>He wants to feel through all that his
refuge is in her arms as hers is in his. He
wants a wife upon whose breast he can lay
his head, when sorrows come, and weep.
He wants one who will make him feel that<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
no matter where else death strikes, as long as
he has her he can endure life. I remember
a man who, when his dearly-beloved sister
died, laid his head on his wife’s shoulder,
weeping, and said, “If it were you I should
die.”</p>

<p>There are in history women upon whose
strong hearts strong men have leaned and
have become more strengthened in that leaning.
Weak men have become manly through
a womanly wife. Strong men have been
weakened by a weak, wicked wife. Truly a
man is made or marred when he marries.
He must indeed ask his wife leave to thrive.</p>

<p>It is in every woman’s power to be a well-loved
wife. She cannot exact it: she must
win it. She has his affection to start upon.
She must increase it, instead of allowing it
to decrease. She must not go upon the
principle that because she is his wife it is his<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>
duty to worship her. If she does, she will
be bankrupt as far as his affection is concerned.
Men are not made in that way, as
I have said before, and you must take them
as you find them if you take one at all.
Many a wife has allowed her husband’s affection
to die. She has fancied, maybe, that she
was lowering her dignity to try to keep what
she considered was her due. Nothing is
our due of which we are not worthy. We
are not worthy of a love we do not try to
keep. Women who are exacting after marriage
are generally the ones who tried the
hardest to attract the man at first. It is
generally the girl who runs after a man till
she gets him who makes no effort after marriage
to retain his love, and who talks the
loudest about her “rights, and not grovelling
at his feet,” if it is suggested that she do
better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>Before she married she dressed for him.
Nothing she owned was too pretty to put
on when she knew he would see her. She
was careful to be tidy in her person. She
would never let him see a room in her home
which was in disorder. She was courteous
always. She never said an impatient word
to him or before him. If he was cross, she
bore it like an angel. She greeted him
always when he came with a sweet smile and
caress. She had loving words for him as
she told him how she wanted to see him
every minute since they had parted. She
desired in every way to appear at her best
before him. She hid every defect of temper
or disposition.</p>

<p>After marriage she does not care how untidy
she is when he comes home. She never
thinks of dressing for him. She is not
courteous to him. She has no loving word,<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>
and she never hesitates to speak a cross one
to him. She has smiles yet for the outside
world, but none for the man whom she has
promised to love and honor. She talks to
him as she would be ashamed to have any
one hear her speak. She never bears with
him. If he is cross, she is crosser. Is it
any wonder she loses his love? She is not
what he thought she was, or what he thought
he was marrying. If he had seen her in her
true colors before the fatal words were
spoken, he never would have bound himself
to her. The beautiful soul, the sweet smile
that won him, are gone. The gentle spirit
he fancied he detected, was a delusion.
What he loved, he does not possess. He
possesses an unwomanly wife, and that he
did not woo. With a weak man there
comes a break. He often seeks his happiness
with another woman. A strong man<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
endures in silence, growing old and sad,
broken in his youth.</p>

<p>Ought this to be? There is no reason,
because you have grown familiar to each
other, you should not try to hide your temper
as you did before. There is no reason,
because he is “caught” and cannot get away
from you, that you should cease to be attractive
to him. You spread your net well.
Now make the nest so attractive that he will
be glad that he was “caught.” Be all that
you led him to fancy you were.</p>

<p>Why should not a woman dress for her
husband? Why should she not cultivate a
sweet disposition for him and endeavor to
make his home the happiest spot on earth?
Why not try to banish from it every cloud,
everything that will annoy or irritate? Is it
of no use? It is of the greatest earthly use.
It is a means of helping you both on to<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
Heaven. If you must be selfish, remember
it is making yourself happier to have your
husband love you as he loves no other
earthly being. Men, after all, are easily
pleased&mdash;you found that out in your courtship
days. They are easily managed too.
A man will do almost everything for the
wife that makes him happy. He is almost
too much of a slave to her. She can do
what she will to him. With him, getting her
own way is only a matter of tact and sweetness.
Husbands are almost all like the man
in the fable of the wind and sun. The sun
beat in the end. Warmth of love and sweetness
of manner will gain a victory, where an
ill-tempered insisting upon “rights” fails
completely.</p>

<p>Ward McAllister says in his “Society as
I Have Found It,” “My advice to all married
women is to keep up flirting with their<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
husbands as much after marriage as before;
to make themselves as attractive after their
marriage as they were when they captivated
them; not to neglect their toilet, but rather
to improve it: to be as coquettish and coy
after they are bound together as before
when no ties held them.”</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>We know that there is an unfortunate tendency
in human nature to treat with levity the subject
of love, courtship and marriage. But a moment’s
consideration should convince you how utterly
repugnant it is to all manly feelings to jest
in these matters. They are the most serious questions
of your life, as your weal or woe, and the
weal and woe of those who come after you, depend
in great measure, upon the wisdom and virtue
with which you conduct your preparations
for marriage. The whole tendency of such lightness
is to cause the marriage relation to be lightly<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
esteemed, and the true aim of courtship to be lost
sight of, for unless you view it in its true light,
with that sober earnestness which the subject demands,
your courtship will be nothing more than
a grand game of hypocrisy, resulting in misery
the most deplorable.</p>


<h3>LOVE.</h3>

<p>Love is an actual need, an urgent requirement
of the heart. Every properly constituted human
being who entertains an appreciation of loneliness
and looks forward to a home of happiness and
content, feels the necessity of loving.</p>

<p>Without love, life is unfinished; hope, without
aim; nature defective, and man miserable. Love
is the ruling element of life; the great instrument
of nature; that soft, subduing sun against whose
melting beams there is not one human soul in a
million, not a thousand men in all earth’s domain,
whose hearts are hardened. Love, if pure, unselfish
and discreet, constitutes the chief happiness
of human life. No man or woman is complete in
their experience of life until they have been subdued<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
into union with the world through their
affections. The bosom which does not feel love
is cold; the mind which does not conceive it is
dull; the philosophy which does not accept it is
false; the only true religion in the world has pure,
undying love for its basis. Look back over your
life; if there is a bright spot to be seen, it is where
the star of love shed its light; if there is a plant,
flower or any beautiful thing visible it is where
the smiles and tears of your affections were spent;
where some fond eye met your own; where some
endearing heart was clasped to yours.</p>

<p>Love, to make your life and home beautiful,
must shine on through years, and its radiance
linger till the shadows of death darken altogether.</p>


<h3>COURTSHIP</h3>

<p>Is the first turning point in your life, crowded
with perils and temptations. The rose tints of
affection dazzle and bewilder your imagination.
You should not trust too much to the impulse of
the heart, or be too easily captivated by a winning
exterior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[148]</span></p>

<p>Not once in a hundred times do two natures,
brought side by side, harmonize in every part.
While always bearing in mind that life without
love is a wilderness, it should not be overlooked
that true affection requires solid support. Your
object in courtship should not be to charm, gratify,
nor please simply for the present pleasure,
but for the selection of a companion who must
bear, suffer and enjoy life with you in all its
forms; one who will walk pleasantly, willingly
and confidingly by your side through all the intricate
and changing vicissitudes incident to mortal
life; one possessed of a constitution of soul
similar to your own; of similar age, opinions,
tastes, habits, modes of thought and feeling; one
who under any given combination of circumstances
would be affected as you would; one who
would approve what you approve and condemn
what you condemn; not for the purpose of agreeing
with you but of her own free will; one who is
already united to you by the ties of spiritual harmony.
In the selection of a wife, a pure, loving
heart and good common sense are many times
more valuable than personal beauty or wealth,
for once installed in the affections of such a
woman, you have a life claim on her good offices,<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
and no sacrifice that she can make is too great, no
adversity so strong that it can shake her firmness.
True courtship is withal a beautiful sight.
Only the coarse and illiterate can see there
aught for ridicule or jest. It is the flowing together
of two separate lives that have heretofore
been divided, now mysteriously brought together,
to flow on through all time, and only God in His
infinite wisdom knows how far in the shadowy
hereafter.</p>


<h3>MARRIAGE.</h3>

<p>For all professions, trades and callings in life,
men and women prepare themselves by previous
attention to their principles and duties. They
study them, devote time and money to them.
Every imaginable case, difficulty or trial is considered
and duly disposed of according to the
general principles of the trade or profession. But
marriage, the most important and holy relation
of life, involving the most sacred responsibilities
and influences, social, civil and religious, that
bear upon men and women, is entered upon in hot<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
haste or blind stupidity by a great majority of the
men and women of to-day.</p>

<p>No man has a right to ask a woman to enter
matrimonial bonds with him unless he is thoroughly
acquainted with the female constitution
and character, for he who knows not her nature
knows not how to gratify or satisfy that nature.
It is ignorance in these matters that causes a great
amount of matrimonial infelicity. Marriage, to
be a blessing, must be properly entered. It has
its fundamental laws, which must be obeyed.</p>

<p>The conditions upon which its joys and advantages
are realized may be learned beforehand,
and should not be entered in blindness, but in the
light of a perfect knowledge of its rules and
regulations, its promises, conditions, laws and
privileges, so that no uncertainty shall follow
a knowledge of its reality. Some are disappointed
in marriage because they expect too
much from it. Their imagination has pictured
a condition of things never experienced on this
side of heaven. With the marriage ceremony you
enter a new world, if you enter understandingly,
and live as becomes thoughtful, considerate human
beings, each trying to bear with the other’s
infirmities, and to consider the other’s happiness<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
as paramount to their own. Marriage then becomes
a delightful scene of domestic happiness,
to which all true men and women look forward
as the condition of life most consonant to their
true happiness.</p>


<h3>SELECTION OF A HUSBAND.</h3>

<p>To the young woman who is just about to determine
her start in life, we would say: Give up
your whole mind to this problem of finding a husband
whom you can love, and who can love you.
It is worthy of your utmost effort. Remember
that in selecting the father of your child the qualities
which will show in the little one have no relation
to his accomplishments, and that even the
homeliest features may become beautiful, shining
with the light of his noble qualities.</p>

<p>The profession of motherhood stands ready to
give you every repayment if you will but devote
to fitting yourself for its duties the same patient
effort you would give to the study of any science,
or the same energy you would throw into social
duties.</p>

<p>Unlike social distinction, it will not be disappointing;<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
but as the years go by, loving children
will stand ready to enthrone you in their hearts
and gratefully recognize your every effort in their
behalf.</p>

<p><em>First</em>&mdash;Give perfect truth and exact it.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>&mdash;Use every endeavor to eradicate your
own faults, and gently, patiently and lovingly
help your companion to do the same.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>&mdash;Do not expect too much from either
yourself or your mate. Be humble, with a clear
understanding of your own limitations; but be
firm in the determination that with each day you
will climb together to a higher level.</p>

<p><em>Fourth</em>&mdash;Do not be discouraged at slow progress.
Do not doubt that in the end you will be
repaid for all effort. So also do not doubt that
if you are careless, selfish or deceitful you will
be planting seeds for eventual catastrophe.</p>


<h3>WHAT PLEASES MEN AND WOMEN.</h3>


<h4>THE WOMAN.</h4>

<p>It pleases her to be told that she is fascinating;
to be called well dressed; to be called sensible; to<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
depend on some man and pretend that she is ruling
him; to be told that she improves man by her
companionship; to be treated courteously and with
respect, and to be talked to reasonably.</p>

<p>It pleases her to be treated sensibly and honestly;
to be considered and questioned, and not
treated as a butterfly with no head or heart. It
pleases her to be loved and admired by a man
who is strong enough to subdue her and make <em>his</em>
way her way; to lead her and take care of her;
and it pleases her to find happiness in being ruled
by an intellect that she can look up to admiringly,
and one to whom her mind bows in reverence.</p>


<h4>THE MAN.</h4>

<p>It pleases the man to have a woman love him;
to have her lead him in the way he wants to
go; to have her sometimes treat him as a great
big baby, to be cared for, petted and caressed;
also to have her think him great, and good, and
true, and favor him with her attentions accordingly.
It pleases him to have a woman’s bright
eyes expressing the approbation, approval and admiration
the lips do not speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>It pleases him to have her hand smooth away
the careworn expression and wrinkles from his
brow, and to have her strength to help him over
the weak places in life. It pleases a worthy man
who tries to be good to have a sweet woman lead
him in the way called beautiful. A woman can
sink a man to the depths of misery or help him to
the zenith of happiness; her smile inspires him.</p>


<h3>MOODY’S EULOGY ON WOMEN.</h3>

<p>“I think that the Almighty intended the work
of woman in this world should be, above all, the
rearing of a family. He gave into her keeping
the souls and characters of the young, to make or
mar. And surely there is no nobler or more responsible
work than this. From the home&mdash;the
domain of woman&mdash;spring most of the highest
impulses of humanity. And to fit woman for her
great work the Creator made her of a finer cast
than man; there is nothing on earth so noble, so
pure, so exalted, so near the ideal of character,
as a woman. Woman can rise higher than man,
but she can likewise sink lower. The very height<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
which she can attain seems to make her fall the
greater when she does fall. There is great
strength and great weakness in woman’s character;
and it is a vital duty of men, whose greater
evenness of temperament gives them greater self-control,
and consequently a commanding position,
to do everything in their power to enable the
woman to be true to her higher nature.</p>

<p>“I believe that, other things being equal, the
happiest woman is the woman who is a mother
and the maker of a home; but if she cannot fulfil
her true destiny, if she must enter the business
world, she should be given the greatest consideration,
simply because she is a woman. I have
heard women say that they ask for nothing on
the ground of sex. Perhaps they don’t, but personally
I cannot forget their sex. Even in a
purely business matter, my attitude and manner
toward them are not just what they would be
toward men.”&mdash;<em>Dwight L. Moody.</em></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“God has made the mind of woman the complement
to the mind of man.</p>

<p>“When properly coupled they are a source of
strength to each other. As steel and flint strike
fire, so the brightest wit and best thought spring<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>
from the intellectual union of man and wife. Beginning
as a stimulus to research and higher endeavor,
each learns to know the mind of the other.
A glance often reads thought without the spoken
word.”</p>

<h3>A LOW VOICE IN WOMAN.</h3>

<p>Yes, we agree with that old poet, who said that
a low, soft voice was an excellent thing in woman.
Indeed, we feel inclined to go much farther than
he has on the subject, and call it one of her crowning
charms. How often the spell of beauty is
rudely broken by coarse, loud talking! How often
you are irresistibly drawn to a plain, unassuming
woman, whose soft, silvery tones render her positively
attractive. In the social circle, how pleasant
it is to hear a woman talk in that low key
which always characterizes the true lady. In the
sanctuary of home how such a voice soothes the
fretful child and cheers the weary husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>


<h3>CONNUBIALITIES.</h3>

<p>It is the hardest thing in love to feign it where
it is not, or hide it where it is; but it is easier
counterfeited than concealed. The face of her
we love is the fairest of sights, and her voice the
sweetest harmony in the world. A man is more
reserved in his friend’s concerns than in his own;
a woman, on the contrary, keeps her own concerns
better than another’s. A woman will think herself
slighted if she is not courted, yet pretends to
know herself too well to believe your flattery.
Absence is to love what fasting is to the body; a
little stimulates it, but a long abstinence is fatal.
The greatest pleasure of life is love; the greatest
treasure, contentment; the greatest possession,
health; the greatest ease is sleep; and the greatest
medicine, a true friend.</p>

<h3>THE MARRIAGE QUESTION.</h3>

<p>“Thousands marry and the majority of them
live together all their lives. But I think that not
more than one couple in ten love each other, continuously,
during that time.</p>

<p>“As soon as they have taken the marriage vows
they feel an ownership of each other, feel that
they are bound so that they cannot get away, and
so grow careless about each other’s comforts and
pleasures, until, before they realize it, love has
flown, and then it depends upon the dispositions
of the two whether it is a cat-and-dog life or one
of friendship and companionship without love.
Remember this: It is nature to love, and if you
do not retain the love of your husband or wife,
some one else is liable to do so.</p>

<p>“For a while you may bind a person to you by<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
marriage vows, but love can only be bound by
love, and it takes the same devotion, the same
love after it is won that it takes to win it in the
first place.”&mdash;<em>Goe Van Hise</em>, Glendale, Cal.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many boys and girls enter matrimony before
they are old enough to realize the responsibility
they assume, and they frequently fill their lives
with bitterness by acting so rashly. Wait till you
are old enough to exercise judgment in the choice
of your companion; then choose wisely, and enthrone
the goddess of Love upon a heart stamped
with eternal fidelity, and be your home a palace
or a cottage, it will indeed be a “sweet, sweet
home.”</p>


<h3>THE AGES OF LOVE.</h3>

<p>The Outlook, in the Thorwaldsen Gallery,
Copenhagen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Friend&mdash;It reminds me forcibly of the time
when “they were both naked and were not
ashamed.” Indeed, it gave me a new comprehension
of the meaning of that text.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<p>Guide&mdash;Which of all Thorwaldsen’s works did
you like the best?</p>

<p>Philosopher&mdash;How is it possible to tell? There
were at least a dozen best.</p>

<p>Friend&mdash;The “Ages of Love,” because it suggested
a sermon to me which I am going to preach
some time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The “Ages of Love” is a bas-relief consisting
essentially of six figures, though so combined as to
make, as it were, one tableau. In the first, a covered
basket contains a number of imprisoned
Cupids, and a child is curiously lifting a corner
of the cover to look in and learn what love is like.
In the second an attendant female figure&mdash;Venus?&mdash;has
taken a Cupid out of the basket, and a
maiden is eagerly and imploringly reaching out
both hands to receive it. In the third her prayer
has been granted, and the woman clasps the Cupid
to her breast. In the fourth the woman is still
holding Cupid, but carelessly by the wings, her
mind evidently on other things intent. In the fifth
a man sits looking upon the ground, while Cupid
sits perched upon his back, and he knows not why
he is there. In the sixth Cupid has taken his
flight and is just beyond the reach of an old man,<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
who stretches out his hands in vain to recover the
fugitive.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Guide&mdash;And pray, parson, what would your
sermon be?</p>

<p>Friend&mdash;Just Thorwaldsen’s sermon; nothing
more. It would be in five subdivisions. First:
Childhood inquiring into love. It is right to inquire.
The father and mother should answer
the inquiry and not leave the child to learn of
this most sacred mystery of life from profane
lips. Second: Maidenhood seeking love. She
is right to seek it. It is idle to sing, “Love not,
love not! the thing you love will die.” Love is
“the greatest thing in the world,” above all others
best worth seeking. Third: Motherhood possessing.
Love is wealth indeed, and the only
wealth worth having. The poorest is rich if he
have love, and the richest is poor if he have it not.
Fourth: Manhood forgetting love. Alas, that
so many of us no sooner possess love than we
forget it, and are indifferent to it, and put it
aside. Love, the most valuable of all knowledge,
has been bestowed on us, and we forget it; the
most sacred of all possessions has been given us,
and we turn our backs upon it. Ambition usurps<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
love’s crown, and the true king is forgotten. And
thus, fifth, and last of all: Love, forgotten, flies
away, and the unloved old man looks longingly
about for some one to love him, and there is none,
and he drops into his grave unloved and not
missed. It is the tragedy of life: youth inquiring;
maidenhood seeking; motherhood possessing;
manhood forgetting; old age losing.</p>

<p>Guide&mdash;When you preach that sermon, give us
notice and we will come to hear it.</p>

<p>Friend&mdash;Better, instead, buy a photograph of
Thorwaldsen’s bas-relief and study that. The
sermon is all there&mdash;and more is there besides.</p>

<h3>KIND WORDS.</h3>

<p>Kind words may prove pearls of the highest
price; soften and turn away wrath; make friendship
out of enmity, and build a monument of good
that the storms of time cannot destroy. Cherish
them, dear boys and girls. A kind heart full of
love and sympathy and loving words, will spring
to your lips to bless, to help and to comfort all
around you. “That which the fountain sends
forth returns again to the fountain.”</p>

<h3>SIN.</h3>

<p>“Sin is the most expensive thing possible. It
wastes money. It wears the body into decay.
But, bad as these things are, there are even worse
behind, for it blights the intellect and withers the
moral nature of man. It weakens the will; it
blunts the conscience; it hardens the heart. It
dries up all the finer feelings of the soul, so that
ultimately all regard for truth and holiness and
purity is gone. But worse yet, sin is an enslaving<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
thing. It becomes the master of the man
who indulges in it and sets him to do the hardest
drudgery. It hires him out, as it were, to feed
swine, leaving him to feed along with them. That
which was at first a joy becomes in the end a bondage.
That which was first a pleasant companion
becomes at length a cruel task-master, which compels
him to make bricks without straw, and sometimes
even without clay.”&mdash;<em>Dr. W. M. Taylor.</em></p>

<p>Let not sin, therefore, reign in your
M-O-R-T-A-L body.&mdash;Rom. vi. 12.</p>

<h3>HOW TO TALK TO MEN.</h3>

<p>There are many young girls who complain that
they do not know how to talk to men. They have
probably been brought up almost exclusively
among their own sex, and, therefore, look upon
men very much as upon beings of another world,
and when they find themselves in masculine society
they are at a loss to know how to make themselves
agreeable, and what to talk about. Their
task would be lightened if they realized that men
are, after all, very nearly akin to themselves, and
that they have very much the same ideas, feelings
and sentiments. The failure to recognize this
fact generally earns them the character among
their male acquaintances for unamiability or
pride; seldom, indeed, are they credited with the
timidity of ignorance. The girl who generally
is acceptable with men is without self-consciousness,
and talks to a man much in the same style
as she would to a girl friend.</p>

<p>She is not always thinking of herself and the impression
she creates, but she is kind and sympathetic,
and she interests herself in him and his
affairs, and lets him feel it; always, however,<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
taking care to avoid excess in this respect. When
talking with him she shows interest in the matter
under discussion, but, while holding to her own
opinions, she takes care not to assert them with
too great eagerness.</p>

<p>No man was ever really influenced by a self-assertive,
dogmatic woman, and the woman who
wishes to have men friends must remember that
the secret of both her power and her popularity
lies in her gentleness, sweetness and good temper.
She must be cheery, too, and ready with her
smiles; but that is quite another thing, be it remembered,
from the senseless giggling which
some girls seem to fancy is particularly charming
to the other sex.</p>


<h3>ABOUT ATTRACTING HUSBANDS.</h3>

<p>Men have, since the world began, been angled
for deliberately by girls, and times out of count
have been caught.</p>

<p>Girls will continue to fish for husbands, and
will continue to catch them as long as marriage<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
is a fashion&mdash;a state likely to coincide with the
length of time the world lasts.</p>

<p>But for all that, it need not be asserted, as it
so often is, that all girls angle. Why should the
word be used, moreover, with such bitterness?
Surely it is not wrong of girls to behave charmingly
and make themselves look attractive and
pretty, and especially so in the eyes of those men
for whose good opinion they are most anxious?
If they were to wear sackcloth and go about veritable
kill-joys, is it likely that they would succeed
in winning what they want?</p>

<p>It is said that love is never evenly distributed,
and that in every engaged couple there is more
love on one side than on the other. Women fall
in love with the opposite sex just as often as the
opposite sex does with them. What is to happen
if a girl sees a man she believes she could
fondly love, and whom she is sure would fondly
love her, if she is debarred from angling for him?</p>

<p>A girl may not propose to a man. She may
not put to him the anxious question, “Do you love
me?” From her lips it would be unpardonable
were the tender pleading, “Will you marry me?”
to proceed. But she sees one whom she has good
reason to think she could wed and be happy with,<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
and the sole step she can rightly take to bring
about a declaration of love from him is just this:
She can make herself so pleasant and fascinating
that he falls in love with her, and asks her that
sweet question she has so deeply longed to hear
from him.</p>

<p>The feminine angler should be very cautious.
Let her declare her purpose&mdash;should it be only by
a startled word&mdash;and a hundred eyes will dart
scorn at her, a hundred tongues condemn her.
She who is wise, however, is careful&mdash;both for
the sake of the man she loves and her own reputation&mdash;that
the little wiles she practices shall
appeal only to him, and shall not be observable
by those onlookers who are popularly supposed
to see most of the game. Women are undoubtedly
endowed with a special measure of instinct,
and are therefore able to accomplish wonders, apparently
never planned or premeditated. Woe
be it to the swain who does not want to fall in
love, should some fair daughter of Eve will that
he shall!</p>

<p>There is this to console him, however: that the
said daughter of Eve, should she be discreet and
diplomatic, will so work matters that the happy
man will never guess that he has been singled out<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
for preference. He will take the bait and greedily
swallow it, all the time under the impression
that he was the angler, and that it was only after
the greatest struggle that he managed to land his
prize.</p>

<p>He will be as proud of his achievement as he
can be&mdash;that is to say, if the girl who has caught
him has been very canny during her maneuvers.
She need not be deceitful, nor forward, nor unwomanly,
nor any of the other plain-spoken and
objectionable epithets applied to the feminine
angler.</p>

<p>As has been pointed out, she need merely be a
tactful, purposeful, clever girl, one who, knowing
her own powers to charm, exercises them for the
most valuable end and aim life offers&mdash;that of
forming a home in which two persons may be
happy, and from which they may radiate a sufficiency
of joy to make the world about it more contented
and felicitous than it was before.</p>

<p>Do marriages arranged as an outcome of the
angling principle turn out well? Does the fascinating
little woman whose bright eyes, pretty
ways and dainty dress won her a husband, having
secured what she desired, make for the man whose
helpmeet she has elected to be a good wife? If<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
she does, a dozen to one he will never find out
that he was caught; or if she in some sweet moment
should divulge to him the secret, and tell
him in whispers and with shy kisses, how she did
her best to draw him to her, he will, with further
kisses, solemnly declare unto her his delight and
gratitude that she so thoughtfully and cleverly
made things easy for a blundering idiot like himself.</p>

<p>On the contrary, should she abandon every
effort to please directly or soon after the golden
circlet is firmly on her finger, how rapidly will
his eyes be opened to all the crude and ugly scheming
she employed to secure him! How bitterly
will he rue the weak moment in which he succumbed
to her blandishments. Then will the
memory of her charming little speeches and sweet
little ways be dust and ashes to him. He will
cease to believe in women, taught by his captor to
distrust the sex for her sake.</p>

<p>There is all the difference in the world between
the girl who angles honestly, so that a happy
union may be had with the man she loves, and
the girl who angles simply for the achievement
of some tribute to her vanity&mdash;a wealthy husband,
a husband with more money than her<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
friend’s husband possesses, or a husband who will
give her a title and position.</p>

<p>There are few women so purely calculating
that, once having achieved their object, they can
deliberately show themselves in their true colors.
Captious, irritable, ill-tempered, untidy&mdash;all these
distressing characteristics they may reveal to their
miserable husbands later, but for the first few
weeks of marriage they rarely unmask. It is
when the home is settled into, and the regular
routine of existence begins, that the test is fairly
made.</p>

<p>The admirable angler now shows herself in her
true colors. She means to be a good housekeeper,
so she studies her husband’s likes and dislikes, and
incontestably, though silently, demonstrates to
him that since he hates bacon he shall not have it
every morning. Above all, she reflects, and recollects,
and realizes that what he loved her for in
those very early days, when first she taught him
to grow fond of her, were her pretty ways. And
who shall say, with so glorious a result as this
winning woman shall achieve, that she was wrong
in her girlhood to be an angler?</p>

<p>If there were more of them! But there are
more than is imagined. Only it is the happy<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
country that has no history, and the successful
angler that has no historian.</p>


<h3>DUTIES OF AN ENGAGED GIRL.</h3>

<p>An engaged girl should endeavor to be both a
comfort and a help to her lover; not merely a pet
and plaything. It is a very bad augury for the
future when a man instinctively feels that a wax
doll would be of as much use to his worries as
she whom he intends making his helpmeet for
life. And yet, only the other day, a gentleman
was heard to exclaim: “No, no; I would not
trouble Lily for the world; why, she is only made
for the sunshine and the flowers.”</p>

<p>Again, it is the engaged girl’s duty to be open
and candid in all her relations with her lover.
The seeds of much future distrust and unhappiness
are sown if once he suspects she is keeping
a secret from him. It is also her duty to be considerate
of his wishes, and if he have a harmless
antipathy to any little thing or other, let her
humor him in this. No doubt she also has some
little “fads” which require consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>For instance, that girl was wise who ceased
adopting “mannish” ways because her sweetheart
disapproved. By doing so she only rendered herself
more charming than ever in his eyes. To be
punctual is another of the engaged girl’s duties.
She has no more business to keep her lover waiting
than he has to keep her waiting. Tardiness
is not a sign of maidenly indifference, as some
damsels seem to think. It is merely an indication
of bad manners. Of course, it is her bounden
duty to be engaged openly. Her lover should be
known to her parents, and, where practicable,
should visit her at her own house. In conclusion,
I will mention the last and most important
duty of all, and that is that she should love her
lover with her whole heart, mind and strength.
If she does not perform this office thoroughly and
well, the others might just as easily be left alone.</p>


<h3>PREMATURE MATRIMONY.</h3>

<p>Marriage is a divine and beautiful arrangement,
as designed in God’s providence. It is the blending
of two spirits in one. Man is incomplete<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
without his wife: he has strength, she has beauty.
“It is not good that man should be alone.”
“Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Of all the joys that man can feel,
</div><div class="indent1">The purest sure are there.
</div><div class="indent0">While o’er his heart affections steal,
</div><div class="indent1">Like balmy summer air;
</div><div class="indent0">His wife’s caress, his children’s smile,
</div><div class="indent0">Unlike the world are free from guile.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Premature marriages are among the greatest
evils of the times&mdash;the result of fancy. The ballroom
or evening party never develops real character.
Matches made at such places, or made
under similar circumstances, are not of the class
that originate in heaven. They more generally
are conceived in the opposite place, and bring
forth only iniquity.</p>

<p>The true way to study and learn one another
is to do it at home, in the parlor, in the kitchen,
and on occasions that test the temper. We see
the result of premature unions in the almost daily
divorces that are taking place; in the running
away of husbands&mdash;leaving their wives and children
to starve&mdash;and in the elopement of wives.<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
Not only this, but we witness it in broken-spirited
men, made old in the prime of life, struggling on
for mere food, clothing, and mere shelter; and in
woman, cross, sluttish and wrinkled. And the
result does not stop with the husband and wife.
There are the children; they partake of the feebleness
and vices of the parents, both physical and
moral, and go out into the world stunted and
gnarled. Young friends, <em>beware</em>!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“O lasses take care where fancy lights,
</div><div class="indent1">This world’s full of snares:
</div><div class="indent0">The end of frolicsome fancy’s flights
</div><div class="indent1">Is oft a nest of cares.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>A judicious writer, alluding to the matrimonial
state, says: “There is not a city, scarcely a
township, which does not number among its inhabitants
women who have married on very short
acquaintance, only to be abused, deserted, and left
a burden and a lifelong sorrow to the families in
which they were born and reared, and which they
most imprudently and improperly deserted to
share the fortunes of relative strangers.”</p>

<p>If young ladies would realize how grossly indelicate,
as well as culpably reckless, such marriages
appear in the eyes of the observing, they surely<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
would forbear. A year’s thorough acquaintance,
with the most circumstantial accounts, from
disinterested and reliable witnesses, of the antecedents
from childhood, are the very least guarantee
which any woman who realizes what marriage
is, will require of a stranger.</p>

<p>Even then, if her parents are not fully satisfied,
as well as herself, she should still hesitate. Marriage
is an undertaking in which no delay can be
so hazardous as undue precipitation.</p>

<p>“A prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth
himself; but the simple pass on and are punished.”&mdash;<em>Solomon.</em></p>

<p>In how many instances, of the present day, is
marriage merely a union of hands&mdash;the affection
not being taken into consideration. The question
on the one side, “Is she handsome? has she
money?” on the other, “Can he support me in
style? shall I be able to make an appearance?”
How much better would it be to ask, “Has the
woman a heart capable of pure affection?” “Will
she be willing to share with me adversity as well
as prosperity?” “Will she forsake all others and
cleave only to me through weal and woe?”</p>

<p>And woman, yes, woman, she whose very nature
ought to stimulate her to higher and holier<span class="pagenum">[183]</span>
motives for taking upon herself the marriage relation,
is too often anxious only as to the length of
her husband’s purse, and the amount of his bank
stock; the heart, the mind, the intellect, in fact
everything really worth marrying for, being non-essentials.</p>

<p>But, oh, the misery which too often follows
such marriages! The husband, when it is too
late, laments his blindness and his folly. The
wife is made to realize that riches take to themselves
wings and fly away; and then comes the
consciousness of a want of sympathy and congeniality
of feelings. Both are thrown back upon
themselves, for not a chord in the breast of one
vibrates in unison with the other.</p>

<p>Let the young beware how they enter the marriage
state from such motives, lest they wake too
late from the delusion. Consult the judgment,
and hesitate when that says “Beware.” Let the
property be <em>in</em> rather than <em>with</em> the companion.</p>

<p>Oh, the loneliness of an unwedded heart! The
hands may be united, but to feel that in heart you
are separated must be misery indeed. To think
of being obliged to associate for life with one who
has not a feeling of sympathy with you, and who
is, moreover, in sentiment, taste and feeling<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>
directly opposed to you&mdash;how revolting the
thought! Then, let love, not ambition, lead you
to form those ties that naught but death can honorably
sever.</p>

<p>Weigh well the consequences of one wrong or
hasty step in the choice of a companion for life.
Walk softly here, lest you fall, to rise no more.
Seek wisdom from above. “In all thy ways acknowledge
the Lord, and He shall direct thy
paths.” “Seek first the kingdom of God and His
righteousness” at all times, and you are safe.</p>

<h3>THE GIFT OF GIFTS&mdash;<span class="smcap">A Word to
Husbands</span>.</h3>

<p>Husband, have you this gift of gifts? Has
God in superabounding mercy given you a dear<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
wife, lovely, virtuous, prudent, sensible, intelligent,
and above all a God-fearing wife, meek,
modest, humble, Christlike?&mdash;“an helpmeet” in
very deed? Well, what do you think of it? Do
you appreciate the blessing duly?&mdash;make suitable
returns? <em>Can</em> you do it? Such a gift is unspeakable.
How few, comparatively, appreciate
the gift of a good wife?</p>

<p>A very godly man said to us recently, “I thank
the Lord daily, hourly, for the jewel of a wife
God hath given me.” A distinguished writer&mdash;speaking
of the value of a good wife&mdash;remarks
thus: “In the true wife the husband finds not
affection only, but companionship&mdash;a companionship
with which no other can compare. The family
relation gives retirement without solitude, and
society without the rough intrusion of the world.
It plants in the husband’s dwelling a friend who
can listen to the details of his interests with sympathy,
who can appreciate his repetition of events,
only important as they are embalmed in the heart.
Common friends are linked to us by a slender
thread. We must retain them by ministering, in
some way, to their interest or their enjoyment.
What a luxury it is for a man to feel that in his
house there is a true and affectionate being, in<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
whose presence he may throw off restraint without
danger to his dignity; he may confide without
the fear of treachery, and be sick or unfortunate
without being abandoned. If in the outward
world he grow weary of human selfishness, his
heart can safely trust in one whose soul yearns
for his happiness, and whose indulgence overlooks
his defects.”</p>

<p>Give your wives to understand that you esteem
them above all others; make them your confidants;
confide in them and they will confide in you;
confidence begets confidence, love begets love,
sweetness begets sweetness.</p>

<p>Above all, sympathize with the wives of your
bosoms in the hour of affliction. Rejoice with
them when they rejoice, and weep with them when
they weep. Who, if not a bosom companion, will
wipe from the cheek the falling tear of sorrow?
Finally, husbands, remember that death will soon
sever the connubial cord! When you behold her,
with whom you lived, and toiled, and wept, and
rejoiced, cold and lifeless, laid in the coffin&mdash;</p>

<h3>THE GOOD WIFE.</h3>

<p>Jeremy Taylor says, “If you are for pleasure,
marry; if you prize rosy health, marry; and if
money is your object, marry. A good wife is
heaven’s best gift to man&mdash;his angel and minister
of graces innumerable&mdash;his gem of many virtues&mdash;his
casket of jewels&mdash;her voice, his sweetest
music&mdash;her smiles, his brightest day&mdash;her kiss,
the guardian of his innocence&mdash;her arms, the pale
of his safety, the balm of his health, the balsam
of his life&mdash;her industry, his surest wealth&mdash;her
economy, his safest steward&mdash;her lips his faithful<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
counselors&mdash;her bosom, the safest pillow of his
cares&mdash;and her prayers the ablest advocates of
heaven’s blessings on his head.”</p>

<p>Here, indeed, is a book every
young man or woman should have.
You must have often noticed at
card parties, while sitting or standing
around waiting for late arrivals
to come, there are a few moments
when you wish they’d start, or you wish there
was “something doing.” Just at this moment is
your chance to make a hit with your fortune-telling
by cards. No matter how poor you are at it, the
crowd will flock around you four and five deep. You
will be the king bee, as it were, and you will have
the inward pleasure of making the others feel
like a long skirt on a rainy day&mdash;very damp. In
addition to the above, “Fortune-Telling by the Magic
Crystal” is gone into in detail, giving all the symbols
for a correct divination of the future. “The Oraculum:
or, Napoleon Buonaparte’s Book of Fate” (especially
translated) is given here for perhaps the first
time in the English language. A table of questions
generally applicable has been compiled, and 16 pages
of answers, to suit any temperament or individuality,
are given. “Fortune-Telling With Dice” is very complete,
giving an assorted list of 32 answers to questions
for every possible throw of two dice. Get this
book, study it, and use it at the first opportunity,
and if the girls don’t say you are certainly IT we’ll
refund the money. Here’s a chance to make a hit.</p>

<p>The book contains 100 pages, fully illustrated, is
bound in paper cover, and will be sent by mail, postpaid,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
